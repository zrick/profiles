An initial value problem for the coupled equations of motion and thermodynamic energy is solved for air parcels suddenly freed of a frictional constraint near sunset. The notion of a tilted residual layer is introduced and used to relate initial (sunset) air parcel buoyancy to freeatmosphere stratification and thermal structure of the boundary layer.},

This function measures correlations that occur at the same rate or frequency with respect to the data acquisition time. The complex cross-correlation function yields real and imaginary components that contain information about the phase behavior of the variables. The real component provides information about mutually dependent in-phase variations. Variations that occur out-of-phase Žwith time lags or leads. are given by the imaginary component. Two-dimensional correlation analysis is a general analysis method that can be used for the treatment of data from a variety of applications including image, distribution, environmental, and kinetic analysis. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {In the early 1960s, it was established that the stochastic initial value problem for weakly coupled wave systems has a natural asymptotic closure induced by the dispersive properties of the waves and the large separation of linear and nonlinear time scales. One is thereby led to kinetic equations for the redistribution of spectral densities via three- and four-wave resonances together with a nonlinear renormalization of the frequency. The kinetic equations have equilibrium solutions which are much richer than the familiar thermodynamic, Fermi–Dirac or Bose–Einstein spectra and admit in addition ﬁnite ﬂux (Kolmogorov–Zakharov) solutions which describe the transfer of conserved densities (e.g. energy) between sources and sinks. There is much one can learn from the kinetic equations about the behavior of particular systems of interest including insights in connection with the phenomenon of intermittency. What we would like to convince you is that what we call weak or wave turbulence is every bit as rich as the macho turbulence of 3D hydrodynamics at high Reynolds numbers and, moreover, is analytically more tractable. It is an excellent paradigm for the study of many-body Hamiltonian systems which are driven far from equilibrium by the presence of external forcing and damping. In almost all cases, it contains within its solutions behavior which invalidates the premises on which the theory is based in some spectral range. We give some new results concerning the dynamic breakdown of the weak turbulence description and discuss the fully nonlinear and intermittent behavior which follows. These results may also be important for proving or disproving the global existence of solutions for the underlying partial differential equations. Wave turbulence is a subject to which many have made important contributions. But no contributions have been more fundamental than those of Volodja Zakharov whose 60th birthday we celebrate at this meeting. He was the ﬁrst to appreciate that the kinetic equations admit a far richer class of solutions than the ﬂuxless thermodynamic solutions of equilibrium systems and to realize the central roles that ﬁnite ﬂux solutions play in non-equilibrium systems. It is appropriate, therefore, that we call these Kolmogorov–Zakharov (KZ) spectra. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The Reynolds number based on the geostrophic wind G, the Ekman layer depth D and the kinematic viscosity ν is 410, which is almost equal to that of Coleman et al.(JFM, 1990) The Grashof number is set to be Gr=0, 3.15×106, 6.30×106, 1.26×107 and 3.15×107 in order to examine the effect of the stable stratification. A temperature field is so introduced that its mean profile is quasi-steady with time. As the result, statistical quantities are obtained for both velocity and temperature fields.},

Numerical experiments are conducted for homogeneous surface forcings over infinite planar slopes. The simulated flows are the turbulent analogs of the Prandtl (1942) one-dimensional laminar slope flow. The simulated flows achieve quasi-steady periodic regimes at large times, with turbulent fluctuations being modified by persistent low-frequency oscillatory motions with frequency equal to the product of the ambient buoyancy frequency and the sine of the slope angle. These oscillatory wave-type motions result from interactions between turbulence and ambient stable stratification despite the temporal constancy of the surface buoyant forcing. The structure of the mean-flow fields and turbulence statistics in simulated slope flows is analyzed. An integral dynamic similarity constraint for steady slope/wall flows forced by surface buoyancy flux is proposed and quantitatively verified against the DNS data.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The influence of spatial surface temperature changes over the Arctic Ocean on the 2-m air temperature variability is estimated using backward trajectories based on ERA-Interim and the JRA25 wind fields. They are initiated at Alert, Barrow and at the Tara drifting station. Three different methods are used. The first one compares mean ice surface temperatures along the trajectories to the observed 2-m air temperatures at the stations. The second one correlates the observed temperatures to air temperatures obtained using a simple Lagrangian box model which only includes the effect of sensible heat fluxes. For the third method, mean sensible heat fluxes from the model are correlated with the difference of the air temperatures at the model starting point and the observed temperatures at the stations. The calculations are based on MODIS ice surface temperatures and four different sets of ice concentration derived from SSM/I and AMSR-E data. Under nearly cloud free conditions, up to 90\% of the 2-m air temperature variance can be explained for Alert, and 60\% for Barrow using these methods. The differences are attributed to the different ice conditions, which are characterized by high ice concentration around Alert and lower ice concentration near Barrow. These results are robust for the different sets of reanalyses and ice concentration data. Near-surface winds of both reanalyses show a large inconsistency in the Central Arctic, which leads to a large difference in the correlations between modeled and observed 2-m air temperatures at Tara. Explained variances amount to 70\% using JRA and only 45\% using ERA. The results also suggest that near-surface temperatures at a given site are influenced by the variability of surface temperatures in a domain of about 150 to 350 km radius around the site.},

Moreover, the components allow for a definition of instantaneous frequencies through complexifying each component by means of the application of the Hilbert transform.

	abstract = {Proper speciﬁcation of model parameters is critical to the performance of land surface models (LSMs). Due to high dimensionality and parameter interaction, estimating parameters of an LSM is a challenging task. Sensitivity analysis (SA) is a tool that can screen out the most inﬂuential parameters on model outputs. In this study, we conducted parameter screening for six output ﬂuxes for the Common Land Model: sensible heat, latent heat, upward longwave radiation, net radiation, soil temperature and soil moisture. A total of 40 adjustable parameters were considered. Five qualitative SA methods, including local, sum-of-trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines, delta test and Morris methods, were compared. The proper sampling design and sufﬁcient sample size necessary to effectively screen out the sensitive parameters were examined. We found that there are 2–8 sensitive parameters, depending on the output type, and about 400 samples are adequate to reliably identify the most sensitive parameters. We also employed a revised Sobol’ sensitivity method to quantify the importance of all parameters. The total effects of the parameters were used to assess the contribution of each parameter to the total variances of the model outputs. The results conﬁrmed that global SA methods can generally identify the most sensitive parameters effectively, while local SA methods result in type I errors (i.e., sensitive parameters labeled as insensitive) or type II errors (i.e., insensitive parameters labeled as sensitive). Finally, we evaluated and conﬁrmed the screening results for their consistency with the physical interpretation of the model parameters.},

A new technique based on the nature of duality that existed among message passing interface communication routines was adopted to parallelize the WRFPLUS model. The registry in the WRF model was extended to automatically generate the tangent linear and adjoint codes of the required communication operations. This approach dramatically speeds up the software development cycle of the parallel tangent linear and adjoint codes and leads to improved parallel efﬁciency.

Although some parameterizations started to address the issue of subgrid variability by introducing a subgrid probability distribution function for relevant quantities, the spatial structure has been typically ignored and thus the subgrid-scale interactions cannot be accounted for physically. Here we present a new statistical-physics-like approach whereby the spatial autocorrelation function can be used to physically capture the net effects of subgrid cloud interaction with radiation. The new approach is able to faithfully reproduce the Monte Carlo 3D simulation results with several orders less computational cost, allowing for more realistic representation of cloud radiation interactions in large-scale models.},

	abstract = {Purpose To describe methods reported in the literature to estimate the beginning or duration of pregnancy in automated health care data, and to present results of validation exercises where available.
Methods Papers reporting methods for determining the beginning or duration of pregnancy were identiﬁed based on Pubmed searches, by consulting investigators with expertise in the ﬁeld and by reviewing conference abstracts and reference lists of relevant papers. From each paper or abstract, we extracted information to characterize the study population, data sources, and estimation algorithm. We then grouped these studies into categories reﬂecting their general methodological approach.
Results Methods were classiﬁed into 5 categories: (i) methods that assign a uniform duration for all pregnancies, (ii) methods that assign pregnancy duration based on preterm-delivery or health care related codes, or codes for other pregnancy outcomes, (iii) methods based on the timing of prenatal care, (iv) methods based on birth weight, and (v) methods that combine elements from 2 and 3. Validation studies evaluating these methods used varied approaches, with results generally reporting on the mistiming of the start of pregnancy, incorrect estimation of the duration of pregnancy, or misclassiﬁcation of drug exposure during pregnancy or early pregnancy.
Conclusions In the absence of accurate information on the beginning or duration of pregnancy, several methods of varying complexity are available to estimate them. Validation studies have been performed for many of them and can serve as a guide for method selection for a particular study. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04364},
	abstract = {In this paper, the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) proposed by Pinelli et al. [1] is implemented for ﬁnite volume approximations of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations solutions in the open source toolbox OpenFOAM version 2.2 (ESI-OpenCFD [2]). Solid obstacles are described using a discrete forcing approach for boundary conditions. Unlike traditional approaches encompassing the presence of a solid body using conformal meshes and imposing no-slip boundary conditions on the boundary faces of the mesh, the solid body is here represented on the Eulerian Cartesian mesh through an ad-hoc body force evaluated on a set of Lagrangian markers. The markers can move across the Eulerian mesh, hence allowing for a straightforward analysis of motion or deformation of the body. The IBM method is described and implemented in PisoFOAM, whose Pressure-Implicit Split-Operator (PISO) solver is modiﬁed accordingly. The presence of the solid body and the divergence-free of the ﬂuid velocity are imposed simultaneously by sub-iterating between IBM and the pressure correction step. This scheme allows for the use of fast optimized Poisson solvers while granting excellent accuracy with respect to the previously mentioned constraints. Various 2D and 3D well-documented test cases of ﬂows around ﬁxed or moving circular cylinders are simulated and carefully validated against existing data from the literature. The capability of the new solver is discussed in terms of accuracy and numerical performances.},

We investigate the propagation of land-surface heterogeneity in a convective boundary layer using an atmosphere and land-surface coupled large-eddy model. Simulations are made for land surfaces of different heterogeneity scales and a uniform land surface. A multi-scale analysis is carried out and it is found that while domain-and-time averaged ﬂuxes and state variables are not sensitive to land-surface heterogeneity, atmospheric patterns are. Close to the surface, atmospheric patterns are dominated by land-surface forced patterns; away from the surface, “eigen” patterns dominate and forced patterns reemerge for large averaging times. While small-scale land-surface features are more rapidly destroyed by turbulence, large-scale features can persist over hundreds of meters.},

	title = {An immersed boundary method with subgrid resolution and improved numerical stability applied to slender bodies in {Stokes} flow},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08216},
	abstract = {The immersed boundary method is a numerical and mathematical formulation for solving ﬂuid-structure interaction problems. It relies on solving ﬂuid equations on an Eulerian ﬂuid grid and interpolating the resulting velocity back onto immersed structures. To resolve slender ﬁbers, the grid spacing must be on the order of the ﬁber radius, and thus the number of required grid points along the ﬁlament must be of the same order as the aspect ratio. Simulations of slender bodies using the IB method can therefore be intractable. A technique is presented to address this problem in the context of Stokes ﬂow. The velocity of the structure is split into a component coming from the underlying ﬂuid grid, which is coarser than normally required, and a component proportional to the force (a drag term). The drag coeﬃcient is set so that a single sphere is represented exactly on a grid of arbitrary meshwidth. Implicit treatment of the drag term removes some of the stability restrictions normally associated with the IB method. This comes at a loss of accuracy, although tests are conducted that show 1-2 digits of relative accuracy can be obtained on coarser grids. After its accuracy and stability are tested, the method is applied to two real world examples: ﬁbers in shear ﬂow and a suspension of ﬁbers. These examples show that the method can reproduce existing results and make reasonable predictions about the viscosity of an aligned ﬁber suspension.},

Numerical experiments are conducted for homogeneous surface forcings over infinite planar slopes. The simulated flows are the turbulent analogs of the Prandtl (1942) one-dimensional laminar slope flow. The simulated flows achieve quasi-steady periodic regimes at large times, with turbulent fluctuations being modified by persistent low-frequency oscillatory motions with frequency equal to the product of the ambient buoyancy frequency and the sine of the slope angle. These oscillatory wave-type motions result from interactions between turbulence and ambient stable stratification despite the temporal constancy of the surface buoyant forcing. The structure of the mean-flow fields and turbulence statistics in simulated slope flows is analyzed. An integral dynamic similarity constraint for steady slope/wall flows forced by surface buoyancy flux is derived and quantitatively verified against the DNS data.},

The theory extends the classical inviscid inertialoscillation model of LLJs to include up- and downslope motion in the boundary layer within a stably stratified environment. The particular scenario considered is typical of LLJs over the Great Plains of the United States: southerly geostrophic wind over terrain that gently slopes down toward the east. First, an initial value problem for the coupled equations of motion and thermodynamic energy is solved for air parcels suddenly freed of a frictional constraint near sunset. The solution is an oscillation that takes, on the hodograph plane, the form of an ellipse having an eastward-oriented major axis and an eccentricity that increases with increasing stratification and slope angle. Next, the notion of a tilted residual layer (TRL) is introduced and used to relate initial (sunset) air parcel buoyancy to free-atmosphere stratification and thermal structure of the boundary layer. Application of the TRL-estimated initial buoyancy in the solution of the initial value problem leads to expressions for peak jet strength and the slope angle that maximizes the jet strength. Analytical results are in reasonable qualitative agreement with observational data.},

This paper reviews models that are based on scale-invariance properties of high-Reynolds-number turbulence in the inertial range. The review starts with the Smagorinsky model, but the focus is on dynamic and similarity subgrid models and on evaluating how well these models reproduce the true impact of the small scales on large-scale physics and how they perform in numerical simulations. Various criteria to evaluate the model performance are discussed, including the so-called a posteriori and a priori studies based on direct numerical simulation and experimental data. Issues are addressed mainly in the context of canonical, incompressible ﬂows, but extensions to scalar-transport, compressible, and reacting ﬂows are also mentioned. Other recent modeling approaches are brieﬂy introduced.},

Those logarithmic eddies are themselves turbulent objects and can be studied in minimal simulation boxes that are much larger than those in the buffer layer. It is argued that, near the wall, the logarithmic eddies are probably the same as the vortex packets identiﬁed by experiments, but that their dynamics does not appear to be especially linked to the buffer layer. Further from the wall, they align into longer superstreaks, although the mechanism remains unclear.},

With common strong stratiﬁcation, similarity theory becomes unreliable. The turbulence structure and interactions with the mean ﬂow and small-scale nonturbulent motions assume a variety of scenarios. The turbulence is intermittent and may no longer fully satisfy the usual conditions for the deﬁnition of turbulence. Nonturbulent motions include wave-like motions and solitary modes, two-dimensional vortical modes, microfronts, intermittent drainage ﬂows, and a host of more complex structures. The main source of turbulence may not be at the surface, but rather may result from shear above the surface inversion. The turbulence is typically not in equilibrium with the nonturbulent motions, sometimes preventing the formation of an inertial subrange. New observational and analysis techniques are expected to advance our understanding of the very stable boundary layer.},

In all three cases, we observe constant ﬂuxes of both global invariants, the mean energy and mean potential enstrophy, from large to small scales. The existence of constant potential enstrophy ﬂux ranges provides the ﬁrst direct empirical evidence in support of the notion of a cascade of potential enstrophy.

The novel parametrization renders the relation between bi-spectrum and three-point correlation function especially transparent as a set of two-dimensional Hankel transforms. It is expected on theoretical grounds, that three-point statistics can be described accurately with only a few multipoles. In particular, we show that in the weakly non-linear regime, the multipoles of the reduced bispectrum, Ql, are signiﬁcant only up to quadrupole. Moreover, the non-linear bias in the weakly non-linear regime only affects the monopole order of these statistics. As a consequence, a simple, novel set of estimators can be constructed to constrain galaxy bias. In addition, the quadrupole to dipole ratio is independent of the bias, thus it becomes a novel diagnostic of the underlying theoretical assumptions: weakly non-linear gravity and perturbative local bias. To illustrate the use of our approach, we present predictions based on both power law, and CDM models. We show that the presently favoured SDSS-WMAP concordance model displays strong “baryon bumps” in the Ql’s. Finally, we sketch out three practical techniques estimate these novel quantities: they amount to new, and for the ﬁrst time edge corrected, estimators for the bispectrum.},

Results. The Coriolis acceleration has two main eﬀects on waves. It transforms pure gravity waves into gravito-inertial waves that have a larger amplitude closer to the equator, and it introduces new waves whose restoring force is mainly the conservation of vorticity.
Conclusions. Taking the Coriolis acceleration into account changes the subtle balance between prograde and retrograde waves in nonrotating stars. It also introduces new types of waves that are either purely prograde or retrograde. We show in this paper where the local deposition of angular momentum by such waves is important.},

	abstract = {The torque in turbulent Taylor-Couette flows for shear Reynolds numbers Re\_S up to 3x10{\textasciicircum}4 at various mean rotations is studied by means of direct numerical simulations for a radius ratio of {\textbackslash}eta=0.71. Convergence of simulations is tested using three criteria of which the agreement of dissipation values estimated from the torque and from the volume dissipation rate turns out to be most demanding. We evaluate the influence of Taylor vortex heights on the torque for a stationary outer cylinder and select a value of the aspect ratio of {\textbackslash}Gamma=2, close to the torque maximum. The connection between the torque and the transverse current J{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}omega of azimuthal motion which can be computed from the velocity field enables us to investigate the local transport resulting in the torque. The typical spatial distribution of the individual convective and viscous contributions to the local current is analysed for a turbulent flow case. To characterise the turbulent statistics of the transport, PDF's of local current fluctuations are compared to experimental wall shear stress measurements. PDF's of instantaneous torques reveal a fluctuation enhancement in the outer region for strong counter-rotation. Moreover, we find for simulations realising the same shear Re\_S{\textgreater}=2x10{\textasciicircum}4 the formation of a torque maximum for moderate counter-rotation with angular velocities {\textbackslash}omega\_o{\textbackslash}approx-0.4{\textbackslash}omega\_i. In contrast, for Re\_S{\textless}=4x10{\textasciicircum}3 the torque features a maximum for a stationary outer cylinder. In addition, the effective torque scaling exponent is shown to also depend on the mean rotation state. Finally, we evaluate a close connection between boundary-layer thicknesses and the torque.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Urban boundary layers (UBLs) can be highly complex due to the heterogeneous roughness and heating of the surface, particularly at night. Due to a general lack of observations, it is not clear whether canonical models of boundary layer mixing are appropriate in modelling air quality in urban areas. This paper reports Doppler lidar observations of turbulence profiles in the centre of London, UK, as part of the second REPARTEE campaign in autumn 2007. Lidar-measured standard deviation of vertical velocity averaged over 30 min intervals generally compared well with in situ sonic anemometer measurements at 190 m on the BT telecommunications Tower. During calm, nocturnal periods, the lidar underestimated turbulent mixing due mainly to limited sampling rate. Mixing height derived from the turbulence, and aerosol layer height from the backscatter profiles, showed similar diurnal cycles ranging from c. 300 to 800 m, increasing to c. 200 to 850 m under clear skies. The aerosol layer height was sometimes significantly different to the mixing height, particularly at night under clear skies. For convective and neutral cases, the scaled turbulence profiles resembled canonical results; this was less clear for the stable case. Lidar observations clearly showed enhanced mixing beneath stratocumulus clouds reaching down on occasion to approximately half daytime boundary layer depth. On one occasion the nocturnal turbulent structure was consistent with a nocturnal jet, suggesting a stable layer. Given the general agreement between observations and canonical turbulence profiles, mixing timescales were calculated for passive scalars released at street level to reach the BT Tower using existing models of turbulent mixing. It was estimated to take c. 10 min to diffuse up to 190 m, rising to between 20 and 50 min at night, depending on stability. Determination of mixing timescales is important when comparing to physico-chemical processes acting on pollutant species measured simultaneously at both the ground and at the BT Tower during the campaign. From the 3 week autumnal data-set there is evidence for occasional stable layers in central London, effectively decoupling surface emissions from air aloft.},

	abstract = {Using a Large-Eddy Simulation model, we have systematically studied the inability of boundary layer turbulence to efﬁciently mix reactive species. This creates regions where the species are accumulated in a correlated or anti-correlated way, thereby modifying the mean reactivity. We quantify this modiﬁcation by the intensity of segregation, IS, and analyse the driving mechanisms: heterogeneity of the surface moisture and heat ﬂuxes, various background wind patterns and non-uniform isoprene emissions. The heterogeneous surface conditions are characterized by cool and wet forested patches with high isoprene emissions, alternated with warm and dry patches that represents pasture with relatively low isoprene emissions. For typical conditions in the Amazon rain forest, applying homogeneous surface forcings and in the absence of free tropospheric NOx, the isopreneOH reaction rate is altered by less than 10 \%. This is substantially smaller than the previously assumed IS of 50 \% in recent large-scale model analyses of tropical rain forest chemistry. Spatial heterogeneous surface emissions enhance the segregation of species, leading to alterations of the chemical reaction rates up to 20 \%. The intensities of segregation are enhanced when the background wind direction is parallel to the borders between the patches and reduced in the case of a perpendicular wind direction. The effects of segregation on trace gas concentrations vary per species. For the highly reactive OH, the differences in concentration averaged over the boundary layer are less than 2 \% compared to homogeneous surface conditions, while the isoprene concentration is increased by as much as 12 \% due to the reduced chemical reaction rates. These processes take place at the sub-grid scale of chemistry transport models and therefore need to be parameterized.},

	abstract = {A parameterization of gravity wave stress generated by subgrid-scale topography is described and tested in a onedimensional version of the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) model. It is argued that in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) where wave reﬂections occur, the so-called WKB method for evaluating wave stress may not be applicable. Gravity waves launched by a subgrid-scale Gaussian ridge are calculated on line using a linear wave model. The total ﬂow is constrained to be convectively stable by using a terrain-height adjustment to decrease wave amplitudes and thereby prevent wave overturning. In this method when the waves grow large enough to overturn, the wave amplitudes are decreased by decreasing the maximum height of the terrain obstacle, H: At each time step, the ARPS model ﬂow is modiﬁed by the divergence of the wave stress. The effects of wave-stress divergence on turbulence parameterization is examined using three turbulence closure schemes, K-theory with constant eddy diffusivity, the Smagorinsky closure, and the turbulence-kinetic energy closure. Also, the effects of vertical grid spacing are tested using spacings of 10, 20, 50 and 100 m: The model is initialized with a hyperbolic-tangent wind proﬁle and constant Brunt–Va.isa.la. frequency. It is shown that wave-stress divergence can lead to elevated layers of turbulence and diffusion where they would not occur in the absence of the wave-stress parameterization. It is also shown that if the vertical grid spacing is too great, then the effects of wave breaking are not fully realized.},

The flux-variance relation for temperature and humidity was investigated over prairie and desert-shrub plant communities. Fluxes were measured by one-dimensional eddy correlation, humidity by fast-response wet-bulb psychrometers and Krypton open-path hygrometers, temperature by fine-wire thermocouples, and mean windspeed by a cup anemometer. The quality of the flux-variance relation proved to be good enough for application to flux measurement. Regressions of flux estimated by the variance technique versus measured flux usually had rZ values greater than 0.97 for sensible heat flux and greater than 0.88 for water vapor flux. More uniform surfaces tended to yield the same flux-variance relations except when fluxes were small. This exception supported the hypothesis that sparse sources of flux may increase variance downwind. Nonuniform surfaces yielded flux-variance relations that were less predictable, although reasonably accurate once determined. The flux-variance relation for humidity was quite variable over dry surfaces with senescent vegetation.},

The height at which the flow becomes approximately independent of horizontal position is called hlerzrlirtg height according to Wieringa (1986). Here. it is proposed to classify the ground surface in a surface-layer grid box of a larger-scale model into several land-use categories. Surface momentum and heat fluxes should be estimated for each category at the blending heighr. The grid-averaged surface fluxes are to be obtained by the average of surface fluxes on each land-use surface weighted by its fractional area. The postulate of computing the surface fluxes at the blending heighr leads to a new formulation of turbulent transfer coefficients.},

We study this deficiency in PBL LES solutions calculated over a range of shear and buoyancy forcing conditions. The discrepancy from similarity forms becomes larger with increasing shear and smaller buoyancy forcing, and persists even with substantial horizontal grid refinement.

The boundary layer was characterized by stable stratification and the presence of a pronounced low level jet at very low height, 30-150 m, above the surface of the sea, The atmospheric surface layer was apparently extremely shallow; thus the non-dimensionalwind gradients and temperature gradients derived from measurements at 8 m do not show adherence to Monin-Obukhov similarity, in sharp contrast to findings from the same site at similar stability conditions but with no low level jet. Instead these quantities are shown to be governed by scales characteristic of stable shear flow away from the surface. The height to the jet centre appears to be an important quantity. Thus, for the cases with the lowest jet height values (30-50 m), some turbulent characteristics of the flow (non-dimensional velocity standard deviations and the correlation between the longitudinaland vertical velocity) have values similar to those found for the zero pressure-gradient laboratory boundary layer over a flat plate (the so called 'canonical' boundary layer) rather than the typical values found in atmospheric boundary-layerflow. It was inferred that the large scale fluctuations known as 'inactive' turbulence, as well as gravity waves, were suppressed in this case.},

Examination of the dependence of the nocturnal boundary layer on stability suggests three regimes: a) the weakly stable case, b) a transition stability regime where many of the variables change rapidly with increasing stability and c) the very stable case. The value of z/L where the downward heat ﬂux is a maximum deﬁnes the stability boundary between the weakly stable and transition regimes, where L is the Obukhov length. In the present analysis, the downward heat ﬂux reaches a maximum at z/L approximately equal to 0.05 for 10 m, although comparison with other data indicates that this is not a universal value. For weaker stability, the heat ﬂux decreases with decreasing z/L due to weaker temperature ﬂuctuations. In the transition stability regime, the heat ﬂux decreases rapidly with increasing stability due to restriction of vertical velocity ﬂuctuations by the increasing stratiﬁcation.},

The model describes adequately the most important mechanisms occurring during the fog evolution.

	abstract = {The ability to simulate atmospheric dispersion with models developed for applied use under stable atmospheric stability conditions is discussed. The paper is based on model simulations of three experimental data sets reported in the literature. The Hanford data set covered weakly stable conditions, the Prairie Grass experiments covered both weakly stable and very stable atmospheric conditions, and the Lillestrøm experiment was carried out during very stable conditions. Simulations of these experiments reported in the literature for eight different models are discussed. Applied models based on the Gaussian plume model concept with the spread parameters described in terms of the Pasquill stability classiﬁcation or Monin–Obukhov similarity relationships are used. Other model types are Lagrangian particle models which also are parameterized in terms of Monin–Obukhov similarity relationships. The applied models describe adequately the dispersion process in a weakly stable atmosphere, but fail during very stable atmospheric conditions. This suggests that Monin–Obukhov similarity theory is an adequate tool for the parameterization of the input parameters to atmospheric dispersion models during weakly stable conditions, but that more detailed parameterisations including other physical processes than those covered by the Monin–Obukhov theory should be developed for the very stable atmosphere.},

This improved version of the model is used to simulate a highly cooled yet fairly windy stable boundary layer with a surface heat ﬂux of wθ o = −0.05 m K s−1 and a geostrophic wind speed of Ug = 15 m s−1. Flow visualization and evaluation of the turbulence statistics from this case reveal the development of a continuously turbulent boundary layer with small-scale structures. The stability of the boundary layer coupled with the presence of a strong capping inversion results in the development of a dominant gravity wave at the top of the stable boundary layer that appears to be related to the most unstable wave predicted by the Taylor–Goldstein equation. As a result of the decay of turbulence aloft, a strong-low level jet forms above the boundary layer. The time dependent behaviour of the jet is compared with Blackadar’s inertial oscillation analysis.},

Our single-layer model has the following features: (a) It is a column model of energy and momentum exchange between an urban surface and the atmosphere, (b) it includes the inﬂuence of street canyons, which are parameterized to represent the urban geometry, (c) it includes shadowing from buildings and reﬂection of radiation, and (d) it estimates both the surface temperatures of, and heat ﬂuxes from, three surface types: roof, wall, and road. In the simulation of the single-layer model, the roof was hottest during the daytime, but coolest from midnight to early morning. This is consistent with output from the multi-layer model and ﬁeld observations at a residential area on a clear, summer day. The diurnal variation of the energy budget from the singlelayer model agrees well with that from the multi-layer model. Our single-layer model’s performance is nearly that of a multi-layer model for studying mesoscale heat islands. Nevertheless, it is simply parameterized, and thus easily included in larger-scale atmospheric models. The slab model has the largest nighttime cooling rate of the three models. To overcome this, it needs more adjustments than for the canopy models.},

	abstract = {The formation of cold air drainage ﬂows in a shallow gully is studied during CASES-99 (Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study). Fast and slow response wind and temperature measurements were obtained on an instrumented 10-m tower located in the gully and from a network of thermistors and two-dimensional sonic anemometers, situated across the gully. Gully ﬂow formed on clear nights even with signiﬁcant synoptic ﬂow. Large variations in surface temperature developed within an hour after sunset and in situ cooling was the dominant factor in wind sheltered locations. The depth of the drainage ﬂow and the height of the down-gully wind speed maximum were found to be largest when the external wind speed above the gully ﬂow is less than 2 m s−1. The shallow drainage current is restricted to a depth of a few metres, and is deepest when the stratiﬁcation is stronger and the external ﬂow is weaker. During the night the drainage ﬂow breaks down, sometimes on several occasions, due to intermittent turbulence and downward ﬂuxes of heat and momentum. The near surface temperature may increase by 6 ◦C in less than 30 min due to the vertical convergence of downward heat ﬂux. The mixing events are related to acceleration of the ﬂow above the gully ﬂow and decreased Richardson number. These warming events also lead to warming of the near surface soil and reduction of the upward soil heat ﬂux. To examine the relative importance of different physical mechanisms that could contribute to the rapid warming, and to characterize the turbulence generated during the intermittent turbulent periods, the sensible heat budget is analyzed and the behaviour of different turbulent parameters is discussed.},

	abstract = {Intermittent breakdowns that accompany wind gusts at the surface are responsible for a large fraction of the turbulent exchange between the surface and the upper boundary layer in the core of clear nights. Vertical and horizontal structure of the breakdowns are investigated using data from a network of 26 stations in an area of 30 km × 30 km. Surface heterogeneity in the area includes complex terrain with different types of land cover. We treat the ﬁne-scale landscape structure near sensors (‘sheltering’) as a separate component of heterogeneity. These features have important consequences on the spatial distribution of mean variables and surface ﬂuxes. We found that breakdowns connect the surface layer to a higher level (level HC ). Weak wind gusts below a threshold (approximately 1.5 m s−1) mix the air down to the colder ground, cooling the surface layer. On the other hand, wind gusts above this threshold promote mixing with upper levels, warming the surface layer. The spatial maximum of surface temperature over the network can be used as an estimate of the temperature at HC , allowing vertical gradients and stability to be approximated. Minimum temperature is a function of topography and sheltering. Appreciable surface ﬂuxes at night occur primarily at high, open locations, and can be large enough there to inﬂuence area-averaged values. Surface-ﬂux parameterizations currently used in mesoscale models were tested ﬁrst by estimating ﬂuxes at each station and aggregating, and then by forming area-averages before estimating ﬂuxes. Results show that these formulations underestimate the average surface ﬂuxes over a region for most of the nights.},

The modiﬁcations involve three parts. First, the heat ﬂux from the entrainment at the inversion layer is incorporated into the heat and momentum proﬁles, and it is used to predict the growth of the PBL directly. Second, proﬁles of the velocity scale and the Prandtl number in the PBL are proposed, in contrast to the constant values used in the TM model. Finally, non-local mixing of momentum was included. The results from the new PBL model and the original TM model are compared with LES data. The TM model was found to give too high PBL heights in the PBL with strong shear, and too low heights for the convection-dominated PBL, which causes unrealistic heat ﬂux proﬁles. The new PBL model improves the predictability of the PBL height and produces proﬁles that are more realistic. Moreover, the new PBL model produces more realistic proﬁles of potential temperature and velocity. We also investigated how each of these three modiﬁcations affects the results, and found that explicit representation of the entrainment rate is the most critical.},

	abstract = {Using the unprecedented observational facilities deployed during the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study (CASES-99), we found three distinct turbulent events on the night of 18 October 1999. These events resulted from a density current, solitary wave, and internal gravity wave, respectively. Our study focuses on the turbulence intermittency generated by the solitary wave and internal gravity wave, and intermittent turbulence episodes associated with pressure change and wind direction shifts adjacent to the ground. Both the solitary and internal gravity waves propagated horizontally and downward. During the passage of both the solitary and internal gravity waves, local thermal and shear instabilities were generated as cold air was pushed above warm air and wind gusts reached to the ground. These thermal and shear instabilities triggered turbulent mixing events. In addition, strong vertical acceleration associated with the solitary wave led to large nonhydrostatic pressure perturbations that were positively correlated with temperature. The directional difference between the propagation of the internal gravity wave and the ambient ﬂow led to lateral rolls. These episodic studies demonstrate that non-local disturbances are responsible for local thermal and shear instabilities, leading to intermittent turbulence in nocturnal boundary layers. The origin of these non-local disturbances needs to be understood to improve mesoscale numerical model performance.},

This fact compells us to work on modiﬁcations to the subgrid turbulence schemes, although there is not any widely accepted theory on anisotropic turbulence. In this work, a LES model is used to determine what range of stable stratiﬁcation can still be simulated with a subgrid turbulence scheme using the Kolmogorov theory for the dissipation. Twenty simulations of increasing stability have been performed using a horizontal resolution of 5 m. The model is able to simulate weakly and moderately stable conditions and experiences runaway cooling for strong stability. The goodness of the successful simulations is inspected through comparison to observations from the experimental campaigns SABLES-98 and CASES-99. Other supplementary tests have been performed on the resolution and the surface boundary condition.},

	abstract = {Two parameterisation schemes for the turbulent surface ﬂuxes and drag coeﬃcients over the Arctic marginal sea-ice zone (MIZ) are (further) developed, and their results are compared with each other. Although the schemes are based on diﬀerent principles (ﬂux averaging and parameter averaging), the resulting drag coeﬃcients diﬀer only slightly in the case of neutral and stable stratiﬁcation. For unstable stratiﬁcation and sea-ice conditions being typical for the north-eastern Fram Strait, the drag coeﬃcients resulting from the parameter-averaging concept are 5–10\% larger than those of the ﬂux-averaging concept. At a sea-ice concentration of 45\%, the parameter-averaging method overestimates the heat ﬂuxes by a factor of 1.2. An inclusion of form-drag in the schemes caused by ﬂoe edges and ridges has a much larger eﬀect on the drag coeﬃcient, and on the momentum ﬂuxes, than the choice between the parameter-averaging or ﬂux-averaging methods. Based on sensitivity studies with the ﬂux-averaging scheme, a simple formula for the eﬀective drag coeﬃcient above the Arctic MIZ is derived. It reduces the computational costs of the more complex parameterisations and could also be used in larger scale models. With this simple formula, the eﬀective drag coeﬃcient can be calculated as a function of the sea-ice concentration and skin drag coeﬃcients for water and ice ﬂoes. The results obtained with this parameterisation diﬀer only slightly from those using the more complex schemes. Finally, it is shown that in the MIZ, drag coeﬃcients for sea-ice models may diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the eﬀective drag coeﬃcients used in atmospheric models.},

The model is a plane horizontally homogeneous channel ﬂow, which is driven by a constant pressure gradient and which has a noslip wall at the bottom and a free-slip wall at the top. At the lower wall a constant negative temperature ﬂux is imposed. First, we consider a direct numerical simulation of the same channel ﬂow. The simulation is computed with the neutral channel ﬂow as initial condition and computed as a function of time for various values of the stability parameter h=L, where h is the channel height and L is related to the Obukhov length. We ﬁnd that a turbulent solution is only possible for h=L {\textless} 1:25 and for larger values turbulence decays. Next, we consider a theoretical model for this channel ﬂow based on a simple gradient transfer closure. The resulting equations allow an exact solution for the case of a stationary ﬂow. The velocity proﬁle for this solution is almost linear as a function of height in most of the channel. In the limit of inﬁnite Reynolds number, the temperature proﬁle has a logarithmic singularity at the upper wall of the channel. For the cases where a turbulent ﬂow is maintained in the numerical simulation, we ﬁnd that the velocity and temperature proﬁles are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical model when the eﬀects of the surface layer on the exchange coeﬃcients are taken into account.},

	abstract = {Turbulence in the very stable nocturnal boundary layer is weak, patchy and intermittent. Near the surface isolated bursts of turbulent activity, characterised by abrupt changes in vertical velocity variance, have been shown to play an important role in determining the vertical transport of pollutants. However, there is little consensus as to the most appropriate methods for identifying or analysing the characteristics of intermittent turbulence that are of direct relevance to air quality studies. This paper presents an original technique, based on wavelet analysis, to objectively isolate intermittent turbulent ‘bursts’ within vertical velocity time series. The technique permits the quantitative description of global intermittency and can be used to assess the duration and strength of turbulence within a time series. The technique is applied to a dataset from a summer ﬁeld experiment in the Lower Fraser Valley, British Columbia, 1998. A very stable nocturnal boundary layer was observed in this region of complex terrain during anticyclonic synoptic conditions. During the 11 nights studied turbulent activity was characterised (within each 30-min time series) by three to four individual bursts persisting for less than 10 min in total. The implications of these results for air quality studies are discussed within the context of the vertical mixing of ozone (stored within the residual layer) to the surface. Results show that, despite the complexity of the processes determining nocturnal surface ozone concentration, the strength and duration of turbulent bursts can play an important role in determining local surface concentrations.},

	abstract = {A primary climate change signal in the central Arctic is the melting of sea ice. This is dependent on the interplay between the atmosphere and the sea ice, which is critically dependent on the exchange of momentum, heat and moisture at the surface. In assessing the realism of climate change scenarios it is vital to know the quality by which these exchanges are modelled in climate simulations. Six state-of-the-art regional-climate models are run for one year in the western Arctic, on a common domain that encompasses the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment ice-drift track. Surface variables, surface ﬂuxes and the vertical structure of the lower troposphere are evaluated using data from the SHEBA experiment. All the models are driven by the same lateral boundary conditions, sea-ice fraction and sea and sea-ice surface temperatures. Surface pressure, near-surface air temperature, speciﬁc humidity and wind speed agree well with observations, with a falling degree of accuracy in that order. Wind speeds have systematic biases in some models, by as much as a few metres per second. The surface radiation ﬂuxes are also surprisingly accurate, given the complexity of the problem. The turbulent momentum ﬂux is acceptable, on average, in most models, but the turbulent heat ﬂuxes are, however, mostly unreliable. Their correlation with observed ﬂuxes is, in principle, insigniﬁcant, and they accumulate over a year to values an order of magnitude larger than observed. Typical instantaneous errors are easily of the same order of magnitude as the observed net atmospheric heat ﬂux. In the light of the sensitivity of the atmosphere–ice interaction to errors in these ﬂuxes, the ice-melt in climate change scenarios must be viewed with considerable caution.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the relevance of accurate surface parameters, in particular soil moisture, and of parameterizations for heterogeneous land surfaces, for the prediction of sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes by a mesoscale weather forecast model with horizontal grid resolution of 7 km. The analysis is based on model integrations for a 30-day period, which are compared both to ﬂux measurements obtained from the LITFASS-2003 ﬁeld experiment and to high-resolution-model (1-km grid spacing) results. At ﬁrst, the relevance of improved parameter sets and input data compared to usual operational practice for an accurate prediction of near-surface ﬂuxes is shown and discussed. It is demonstrated that an observation-based land-surface assimilation scheme leads to an improved soil moisture analysis, which is shown to be essential for the realistic simulation of surface ﬂuxes. Secondly, the implementation of two efﬁcient parameterization strategies for subgrid-scale variability of the surface, the mosaic and the tile approach, is presented. Using these methods, the simulations are in better agreement with measurements than simulations with simple aggregation methods that use effective surface parameters. Integrations with the mosaic approach reproduce high resolution simulations very well and more accurately than simulations with the tile method. Finally, the high resolution simulations are analyzed to justify and discuss the approximations underlying both methods.},

Simulations performed at 1-m and 2-m resolution show only small changes in the mean proﬁles compared to coarser resolutions. Also, sensitivity to subgrid models for individual models highlights their importance in SBL simulation at moderate resolution (6.25 m). Stability functions are derived from the LES using typical mixing lengths used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models. The functions have smaller values than those used in NWP.

The model with these restrictions predicts vertical proﬁles of mean quantities such as temperature that are in good agreement with those obtained from large-eddy simulation of a radiation fog.

At higher levels deviations from the measurements progressively occur. For applied use an extension to the wind proﬁle in the surface layer is formulated for the entire boundary layer, with emphasis on the lowest 200–300 m and considering only wind speeds above 3 m s−1 at 10 m height. The friction velocity is taken to decrease linearly through the boundary layer. The wind proﬁle length scale is composed of three component length scales. In the surface layer the ﬁrst length scale is taken to increase linearly with height with a stability correction following Monin-Obukhov similarity. Above the surface layer the second length scale (LMBL) becomes independent of height but not of stability, and at the top of the boundary layer the third length scale is assumed to be negligible. A simple model for the combined length scale that controls the wind proﬁle and its stability dependence is formulated by inverse summation. Based on these assumptions the wind proﬁle for the entire boundary layer is derived. A parameterization of LMBL is formulated using the geostrophic drag law, which relates friction velocity and geostrophic wind. The empirical parameterization of the resistance law functions A and B in the geostrophic drag law is uncertain, making it impractical. Therefore an expression for the length scale, LMBL, for applied use is suggested, based on measurements from the two sites.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) of a stable atmospheric boundary layer is performed using recently developed dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) models. These models not only calculate the Smagorinsky coefﬁcient and SGS Prandtl number dynamically based on the smallest resolved motions in the ﬂow, they also allow for scale dependence of those coefﬁcients. This dynamic calculation requires statistical averaging for numerical stability. Here, we evaluate three commonly used averaging schemes in stable atmospheric boundary-layer simulations: averaging over horizontal planes, over adjacent grid points, and following ﬂuid particle trajectories. Particular attention is focused on assessing the effect of the different averaging methods on resolved ﬂow statistics and SGS model coefﬁcients. Our results indicate that averaging schemes that allow the coefﬁcients to ﬂuctuate locally give results that are in better agreement with boundary-layer similarity theory and previous LES studies. Even among models that are local, the averaging method is found to affect model coefﬁcient probability density function distributions and turbulent spectra of the resolved velocity and temperature ﬁelds. Overall, averaging along ﬂuid pathlines is found to produce the best combination of self consistent model coefﬁcients, ﬁrst- and second-order ﬂow statistics and insensitivity to grid resolution.},

	abstract = {In stably stratiﬁed ﬂows vertical movement of eddies is limited by the fact that kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, leading to a buoyancy displacement scale zB . Our new mixing-length concept for turbulent transport in the stable boundary layer follows a rigid-wall analogy, in the sense that we assume that the buoyancy length scale is similar to neutral length scaling. This implies that the buoyancy length scale is: B = κB zB , with κB ≈ κ, the von Karman constant. With this concept it is shown that the physical relevance of the local scaling parameter z/ naturally appears, and that the α coefﬁcient of the log-linear similarity functions φm,h = 1 + αz/ is equal to c/κ2, where c is a constant close to unity. The predicted value α ≈ 1/κ2 = 6.25 lies within the range found in observational studies. Finally, it is shown that the traditionally used inverse linear interpolation between the mixing length in the neutral and buoyancy limits is inconsistent with the classical log-linear stability functions. As an alternative, a log-linear consistent interpolation method is proposed.},

	abstract = {Observations from the summer Arctic Ocean Experiment 2001 (AOE-2001) are analysed with a focus on the interactions between mesoscale and boundary-layer dynamics. Wavelet analyses of surface-pressure variations show daylong periods with different characteristics, some featuring episodes of pronounced high-frequency surface-pressure variability, here hypothesized to be caused by trapped gravity waves. These episodes are accompanied by enhanced boundary-layer turbulence and an enhanced spectral gap, but with only minor inﬂuence on the surface stress. During these episodes, mesoscale phenomena were often encountered and usually identiﬁed as front-like features in the boundary layer, with a peak in drizzle followed by changing temperature. These phenomena resemble synoptic fronts, though they are generally shallow, shorter-lasting, have no signs of frontal clouds, and do not imply a change in air mass. Based on this analysis, we hypothesize that the root cause of the episodes with high-frequency surface-pressure variance are shallow, mesoscale fronts moving across the pack ice. They may be formed due to local-to-regional horizontal contrasts, for example, between air with different lifetimes over the Arctic or with perturbations in the cloud ﬁeld causing differential cooling of the boundary layer. Thermal contrasts sharpen as the air is transported with the mean ﬂow. The propagating mesoscale fronts excite gravity waves, which affect the boundary-layer turbulence and also seem to favour entrainment of free tropospheric air into the boundary layer.},

The ﬂux-based similarity functions for gradients are constant in “nearly-neutral” conditions. In the “very-stable” regime, the dimensionless gradients are exponential, and proportional to (z/ ∗)3/5. The existence of scaling laws in “extremely-stable” conditions is doubtful. The Prandtl number Pr decreases from 0.9 in nearly-neutral conditions and to about 0.7 in the very-stable regime.

In the present work we perform direct numerical simulation of a turbulent open channel ﬂow with a constant (cooling) heat ﬂux imposed at the ground. This conﬁguration provides a very simpliﬁed model for the surface layer at night. As a result of the ground cooling, the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent ﬂuctuations near the ground re-adjust on times of the order of L/uτ , where L is the Obukhov length scale and uτ is the friction velocity. For relatively weak cooling turbulence survives, but when ReL = Luτ /ν 100 turbulence collapses, a situation that is also observed in the ABL. This criterion, which can be locally measured in the ﬁeld, is justiﬁed in terms of the scale separation between the largest and smallest structures of the dynamic sublayer.},

The other, much newer framework is that provided by complex dynamical systems. The former gives prominence to the interpretation of local budgets of turbulence kinetic energy while the latter emphasizes the energy ﬂows necessary to maintain turbulence in a statistically-steady state. It is argued that these frameworks constitute two incompatible paradigms, since the ﬁrst localizes physical interpretation of the RANS kinetic energy budget while the second denies such a simple view. The local interpretation traces back to the way Reynolds himself interpreted his RANS energy equations, which interpretation is examined here and found to be faulty. We present a schematic model for energy ﬂow in convective boundary layers from a complex dynamical systems’ perspective, and use it to re-interpret the RANS energy equation.},

	abstract = {Measurements of atmospheric turbulence made over the Arctic pack ice during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean experiment (SHEBA) are used to determine the limits of applicability of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (in the local scaling formulation) in the stable atmospheric boundary layer. Based on the spectral analysis of wind velocity and air temperature ﬂuctuations, it is shown that, when both the gradient Richardson number, Ri, and the ﬂux Richardson number, Rf, exceed a ‘critical value’ of about 0.20–0.25, the inertial subrange associated with the Richardson–Kolmogorov cascade dies out and vertical turbulent ﬂuxes become small. Some small-scale turbulence survives even in this supercritical regime, but this is non-Kolmogorov turbulence, and it decays rapidly with further increasing stability. Similarity theory is based on the turbulent ﬂuxes in the high-frequency part of the spectra that are associated with energy-containing/ﬂux-carrying eddies. Spectral densities in this high-frequency band diminish as the Richardson–Kolmogorov energy cascade weakens; therefore, the applicability of local Monin–Obukhov similarity theory in stable conditions is limited by the inequalities Ri {\textless} Ricr and R f {\textless} R fcr. However, it is found that R fcr = 0.20–0.25 is a primary threshold for applicability. Applying this prerequisite shows that the data follow classical Monin–Obukhov local z-less predictions after the irrelevant cases (turbulence without the Richardson–Kolmogorov cascade) have been ﬁltered out.},

A data assimilation methodology focused on the surface and the PBL, previously tested in a one-dimensional version of MM5, is applied to 29 May, 6 June, and 7 June 2002 during the International H2O Project over the Southern Great Plains. Model-predicted PBL depth is evaluated against PBL depth diagnosed from data across 4,800 km of airborne lidar data (ﬂight tracks 100–300 km long). The forecast with data assimilation veriﬁes better against observations and is thus used to investigate the environmental conditions that govern PBL depth. The spatial structure in PBL depth is found to be most affected by spatial variations in surface buoyancy ﬂux and capping inversion strength. The spatial scales of surface ﬂux forcing reﬂected in the PBL depth are found through Fourier analysis and multiresolution decomposition. Correlations are {\textless}0.50 at scales of 64 km or less and increase at larger scales for 29 May and 6 June, but on 7 June low correlations are found at all scales, possibly due to greater within-PBL wind speeds, a stronger capping inversion on this day, and clouds. The results suggest a minimum scale, a function of wind speed, below which heterogeneity in surface buoyancy ﬂuxes is not reﬂected directly in PBL depth.},

	abstract = {A model is developed for the large-eddy simulation (LES) of heterogeneous atmosphere and land-surface processes. This couples a LES model with a land-surface scheme. New developments are made to the land-surface scheme to ensure the adequate representation of atmosphere–land-surface transfers on the large-eddy scale. These include, (1) a multi-layer canopy scheme; (2) a method for ﬂux estimates consistent with the large-eddy subgrid closure; and (3) an appropriate soil-layer conﬁguration. The model is then applied to a heterogeneous region with 60-m horizontal resolution and the results are compared with ground-based and airborne measurements. The simulated sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes are found to agree well with the eddy-correlation measurements. Good agreement is also found in the modelled and observed net radiation, ground heat ﬂux, soil temperature and moisture. Based on the model results, we study the patterns of the sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes, how such patterns come into existence, and how large eddies propagate and destroy land-surface signals in the atmosphere. Near the surface, the ﬂux and land-use patterns are found to be closely correlated. In the lower boundary layer, small eddies bearing land-surface signals organize and develop into larger eddies, which carry the signals to considerably higher levels. As a result, the instantaneous ﬂux patterns appear to be unrelated to the land-use patterns, but on average, the correlation between them is signiﬁcant and persistent up to about 650 m. For a given land-surface type, the scatter of the ﬂuxes amounts to several hundred W m−2, due to (1) large-eddy randomness; (2) rapid large-eddy and surface feedback; and (3) local advection related to surface heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Direct numerical simulation of the turbulent Ekman layer over a smooth wall is used to investigate bulk properties of a planetary boundary layer under stable stratiﬁcation. Our simpliﬁed conﬁguration depends on two non-dimensional parameters: a Richardson number characterizing the stratiﬁcation and a Reynolds number characterizing the turbulence scale separation. This simpliﬁed conﬁguration is sufﬁcient to reproduce global intermittency, a turbulence collapse, and the decoupling of the surface from the outer region of the boundary layer. Global intermittency appears even in the absence of local perturbations at the surface; the only requirement is that large-scale structures several times wider than the boundary-layer height have enough space to develop. Analysis of the mean velocity, turbulence kinetic energy, and external intermittency is used to investigate the large-scale structures and corresponding differences between stably stratiﬁed Ekman ﬂow and channel ﬂow. Both conﬁgurations show a similar transition to the turbulence collapse, overshoot of turbulence kinetic energy, and spectral properties. Differences in the outer region resulting from the rotation of the system lead, however, to the generation of enstrophy in the non-turbulent patches of the Ekman ﬂow. The coefﬁcient of the stability correction function from Monin–Obukhov similarity theory is estimated as β ≈ 5.7 in agreement with atmospheric observations, theoretical considerations, and results from stably stratiﬁed channel ﬂows. Our results demonstrate the applicability of this set-up to atmospheric problems despite the intermediate Reynolds number achieved in our simulations.},

	abstract = {Two formulations of the surface thermal boundary condition commonly employed in numerical modelling of atmospheric stably stratiﬁed surface-layer ﬂows are evaluated using analytical considerations and observational data from the Cabauw site in the Netherlands. The ﬁrst condition is stated in terms of the surface heat ﬂux and the second is stated in terms of the vertical potential temperature difference. The similarity relationships used to relate the ﬂux and the difference are based on conventional log-linear expressions for vertical proﬁles of wind velocity and potential temperature. The heat-ﬂux formulation results in two physically meaningful values for the friction velocity with no obvious criteria available to choose between solutions. Both solutions can be obtained numerically, which casts doubt on discarding one of the solutions as was previously suggested based on stability arguments. This solution ambiguity problem is identiﬁed as the key issue of the heat-ﬂux condition formulation. In addition, the agreement between the temperature difference evaluated from similarity solutions and their measurement-derived counterparts from the Cabauw dataset appears to be very poor. Extra caution should be paid to the iterative procedures used in the model algorithms realizing the heat-ﬂux condition as they could often provide only partial solutions for the friction velocity and associated temperature difference. Using temperature difference as the lower boundary condition bypasses the ambiguity problem and provides physically meaningful values of heat ﬂux for a broader range of stability condition in terms of the ﬂux Richardson number. However, the agreement between solutions and observations of the heat ﬂux is again rather poor. In general, there is a great need for practicable similarity relationships capable of treating the vertical turbulent transport of momentum and heat under conditions of strong stratiﬁcation in the surface layer.},

	abstract = {The applicability of the one-way nesting technique for numerical simulations of the heterogeneous atmospheric boundary layer using the large-eddy simulation (LES) framework of the Weather Research and Forecasting model is investigated. The focus of this study is on LES of offshore convective boundary layers. Simulations were carried out using two subgrid-scale models (linear and non-linear) with two different closures [diagnostic and prognostic subgrid-scale turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equations]. We found that the nonlinear backscatter and anisotropy model with a prognostic subgrid-scale TKE equation is capable of providing similar results when performing one-way nested LES to a stand-alone domain having the same grid resolution but using periodic lateral boundary conditions. A good agreement is obtained in terms of velocity shear and turbulent ﬂuxes, while velocity variances are overestimated. A streamwise fetch of 14 km is needed following each domain transition in order for the solution to reach quasi-stationary results and for the velocity spectra to generate proper energy content at high wavelengths, however, a pile-up of energy is observed at the low-wavelength portion of the spectrum on the ﬁrst nested domain. The inclusion of a second nest with higher resolution allows the solution to reach effective grid spacing well within the Kolmogorov inertial subrange of turbulence and develop an appropriate energy cascade that eliminates most of the pile-up of energy at low wavelengths. Consequently, the overestimation of velocity variances is substantially reduced and a considerably better agreement with respect to the stand-alone domain results is achieved.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) under a wide range of stabilities are conducted to educe very-large-scale motions and then to study their dynamics and how they are inﬂuenced by buoyancy. Preliminary ﬂow visualizations suggest that smaller-scale motions that resemble hairpins are embedded in much larger scale streamwise meandering rolls. Using simulations that represent more than 150 h of physical time, many snapshots in the x y-, yz- and x z-planes are then collected to perform snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition and further investigate the large structures. These analyses conﬁrm that large streamwise rolls that share several features with the very-large-scale motions observed in laboratory studies arise as the dominant modes under most stabilities, but the effect of the surface kinematic buoyancy ﬂux on the energy content of these dominant modes is very signiﬁcant. The ﬁrst two modes in the yz-plane in the neutral case contain up to 3 \% of the total turbulent kinetic energy; they also have a vertical tilt angle in the yz-plane of about 0 to 30◦ due to the turning effect associated with the Coriolis force. Unstable cases also feature streamwise rolls, but in the convective ABL they are strengthened by rising plumes in between them, with two to four rolls spanning the whole domain in the ﬁrst few modes; the Coriolis effect is much weaker in the unstable ABL. These rolls are no longer the dominant modes under stable conditions where the ﬁrst mode is observed to contain sheet-like motions with high turbulent kinetic energy. Using these proper orthogonal decomposition modes, we are also able to extract the vertical velocity ﬁelds corresponding to individual modes and then to correlate them with the horizontal velocity or temperature ﬁelds to obtain the momentum and heat ﬂux carried by individual modes. Structurally, the ﬂuxes are explained by the topology of their corresponding modes. However, the fraction of the ﬂuxes produced by the modes is invariably smaller than the fraction of energy they contain, particularly under stable conditions where the ﬁrst modes are found to perform weak counter-gradient ﬂuxes.},

Although these so-called coherent structures are obvious from visual inspection, quantitative assessment is a challenge and many aspects e.g., formation mechanisms and contribution to turbulent ﬂuxes, are discussed controversially. During the “High Deﬁnition Clouds and Precipitation for Advancing Climate Prediction” Observational Prototype Experiment (HOPE) from April to May 2013, an advanced dual Doppler lidar technique was used to image the horizontal wind ﬁeld near the surface for approximately 300 h. A visual inspection method, as well as a two-dimensional integral length scale analysis, were performed to characterize the observations qualitatively and quantitatively. During situations with forcing due to shear, the wind ﬁelds showed characteristic patterns in the form of clearly bordered, elongated areas of enhanced or reduced wind speed, which can be associated with near-surface streaks. During calm situations with strong buoyancy forcing, open cell patterns in the horizontal divergence ﬁeld were observed. The measurement technique used enables the calculation of integral length scales of both horizontal wind components in the streamwise and cross-stream directions. The individual length scales varied considerably during the observation period but were on average shorter during situations with z/L {\textless} 0 compared to strongly stable situations. During unstable situations, which were dominated by wind ﬁelds with structures, the streamwise length scales increased with increasing wind speed, whereas the cross-stream length scales decreased. Consequently, the anisotropy increased from 1 for calm situations to values of 2–3 for wind speeds of 8–10 m s−1. During neutral to stable situations, the eddies were on average quite isotropic in the horizontal plane.},

	abstract = {The coastal discontinuity imposes strong signals to the atmospheric conditions over the sea that are important for wind-energy potential. Here, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the inﬂuence of the land–sea transition on wind conditions in the Baltic Sea using data from an offshore meteorological tower, data from a wind farm, and mesoscale model simulations. Results show a strong induced stable stratiﬁcation when warm inland air ﬂows over a colder sea. This stratiﬁcation demonstrates a strong diurnal pattern and is most pronounced in spring when the land–sea temperature difference is greatest. The strength of the induced stratiﬁcation is proportional to this parameter and inversely proportional to fetch. Extended periods of stable stratiﬁcation lead to increased inﬂuence of inertial oscillations and increased frequency of low-level jets. Furthermore, heterogeneity in land-surface roughness along the coastline is found to produce pronounced horizontal streaks of reduced wind speeds that under stable stratiﬁcation are advected several tens of kilometres over the sea. The intensity and length of the streaks dampen as atmospheric stability decreases. Increasing sea surface roughness leads to a deformation of these streaks with increasing fetch. Slight changes in wind direction shift the path of these advective streaks, which when passing through an offshore wind farm are found to produce large ﬂuctuations in wind power. Implications of these coastline effects on the accurate modelling and forecasting of offshore wind conditions, as well as damage risk to the turbine, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The turbulent energy spectra and cospectra of momentum and sensible heat ﬂuxes are examined theoretically and experimentally with increasing ﬂux Richardson number (Rf) in the stable atmospheric surface layer. A cospectral budget model, previously used to explain the bulk relation between the turbulent Prandtl number (Prt) and the gradient Richardson number (Ri) as well as the relation between Rf and Ri, is employed to interpret ﬁeld measurements over a lake and a glacier. The shapes of the vertical velocity and temperature spectra, needed for closing the cospectral budget model, are ﬁrst examined with increasing Rf. In addition, the wavenumber-dependent relaxation time scales for momentum and heat ﬂuxes are inferred from the cospectral budgets and investigated. Using experimental data and proposed extensions to the cospectral budget model, the existence of a ‘−1’ power-law scaling in the temperature spectra but its absence from the vertical velocity spectra is shown to reduce the magnitude of the maximum ﬂux Richardson number (Rfm), which is commonly inferred from the Rf –Ri relation when Ri becomes very large (idealized with Ri → ∞). Moreover, dissimilarity in relaxation time scales between momentum and heat ﬂuxes, also affected by the existence of the ‘−1’ power-law scaling in the temperature spectra, leads to Prt = 1 under near-neutral conditions. It is further shown that the production rate of turbulent kinetic energy decreases more rapidly than that of turbulent potential energy as Rf → Rfm, which explains the observed disappearance of the inertial subrange in the vertical velocity spectra at a smaller Rf as compared to its counterpart in the temperature spectra. These results further demonstrate novel linkages between the scale-wise turbulent kinetic energy and potential energy distributions and macroscopic relations such as stability correction functions to the mean ﬂow and the Prt–Ri relation.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of the ﬂow over surfaces with alternating forest patches and clearings of different horizontal scale were performed, modelling the forest canopies as a horizontally homogeneous drag ﬁeld. The objective was to extend previous works that studied the ﬂow over sudden changes in aerodynamic roughness length occurring typically in the transition between small vegetation and forest but neglected the variations of displacement height. It was found that the internal boundary layers that formed in the transition between surface patches initially grew similarly for both the sudden changes of roughness and the alternating forest patches and clearings, but the turbulence produced at the tops of trees could break the regular growth, increasing the vertical propagation of surface heterogeneity and, consequently, the blending height. Also, the forest patches enhanced the Reynolds shear stress at the tree height over the clearings: when the energy extraction by the forest canopy ceased, the turbulent ﬂuctuations increased and the turbulent shear production was kept high over much of the following clearing. Consequently, the Reynolds shear stress over the clearings decayed slowly, or not at all in the case of short patches. This resulted in higher average shear stress and effective aerodynamic roughness length than was the case when variations of displacement height were neglected.},

	abstract = {The effect of a linear stratiﬁcation in the free atmosphere on near-surface properties in a free convective boundary layer (CBL) is investigated by means of direct numerical simulation. We consider two regimes: a neutral stratiﬁcation regime, which represents a CBL that grows into a residual layer, and a strong stratiﬁcation regime, which represents the equilibrium (quasi-steady) entrainment regime. We ﬁnd that the mean buoyancy varies as z−1/3, in agreement with classical similarity theory. However, the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) of the buoyancy ﬂuctuation and the r.m.s. of the vertical velocity vary as z−0.45 and ln z, respectively, both in disagreement with theory. These scaling laws are independent of the stratiﬁcation regime, but the depth over which they are valid depends on the stratiﬁcation. In the strong stratiﬁcation regime, this depth is about 20 to 25 \% of the CBL depth instead of the commonly used 10 \%, which we only observe under neutral conditions. In both regimes, the near-surface ﬂow structure can be interpreted as a hierarchy of circulations attached to the surface. Based on this structure, we deﬁne a new near-surface layer in free convection, the plume-merging layer, that is conceptually different from the constant-ﬂux layer. The varying depth of the plume-merging layer depending on the stratiﬁcation accounts for the varying depth of validity of the scaling laws. These ﬁndings imply that the buoyancy transfer law needed in mixed-layer and single-column models is well described by the classical similarity theory, independent of the stratiﬁcation in the free atmosphere, even though other near-surface properties, such as the r.m.s. of the buoyancy ﬂuctuation and the r.m.s. of the vertical velocity, are inconsistent with that theory.},

	abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of an Ekman layer are performed to study ﬂow evolution during the response of an initially neutral boundary layer to stable stratiﬁcation. The Obukhov length, L, is varied among cases by imposing a range of stable buoyancy ﬂuxes at the surface to mimic ground cooling. The imposition of constant surface buoyancy ﬂux , i.e. constant-ﬂux stability, leads to a buoyancy difference between the ground and background that tends to increase with time, unlike the constant-temperature stability case where a constant surface temperature is imposed. The initial collapse of turbulence in the surface layer owing to surface cooling that occurs over a time scale proportional to L/u∗, where u∗ is the friction velocity, is followed by turbulence recovery. The ﬂow accelerates, and a “low-level jet” (LLJ) with inertial oscillations forms during the turbulence collapse. Turbulence statistics and budgets are examined to understand the recovery of turbulence. Vertical turbulence exchange, primarily by pressure transport, is found to initiate ﬂuctuations in the surface layer and there is rebirth of turbulence through enhanced turbulence production as the LLJ shear increases. The turbulence recovery is not monotonic and exhibits temporal intermittency with several collapse/rebirth episodes. The boundary layer adjusts to an increase in the surface buoyancy ﬂux by increased super-geostrophic velocity and surface stress such that the Obukhov length becomes similar among the cases and sufﬁciently large to allow ﬂuctuations with sustained momentum and heat ﬂuxes. The eventual state of ﬂuctuations, achieved after about two inertial periods ( f t ≈ 4π), corresponds to global intermittency with turbulent patches in an otherwise quiescent background. Our simpliﬁed conﬁguration is sufﬁcient to identify turbulence collapse and rebirth, global and temporal intermittency, as well as formation of low-level jets, as in observations of the stratiﬁed atmospheric boundary layer.},

The analysis suggests that strong turbulent mixing is dominated by relatively large coherent eddies that are not related to local vertical gradients as assumed in MOST. The HOckey-Stick Transition (HOST) hypothesis is developed to explain the generation of observed large coherent eddies over a ﬁnite depth and the contribution of these eddies to vertical variations of turbulence intensity and atmospheric stratiﬁcation throughout the diurnal cycle. The HOST hypothesis emphasizes the connection between dominant turbulent eddies and turbulence generation scales, and the coupling between the turbulence kinetic energy and the turbulence potential energy within the turbulence generation layer in determining turbulence intensity. For turbulence generation directly inﬂuenced by the surface, the HOST hypothesis recognizes the role of the surface both in the vertical variation of momentum and heat ﬂuxes and its boundary effect on the size of the dominant turbulence eddies.},

	abstract = {The performance of an atmospheric single-column model (SCM) is studied systematically for stably-stratiﬁed conditions. To this end, 11 years (2005–2015) of daily SCM simulations were compared to observations from the Cabauw observatory, The Netherlands. Each individual clear-sky night was classiﬁed in terms of the ambient geostrophic wind speed with a 1 m s−1 bin-width. Nights with overcast conditions were ﬁltered out by selecting only those nights with an average net radiation of less than − 30 W m−2. A similar procedure was applied to the observational dataset. A comparison of observed and modelled ensembleaveraged proﬁles of wind speed and potential temperature and time series of turbulent ﬂuxes showed that the model represents the dynamics of the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) at Cabauw very well for a broad range of mechanical forcing conditions. No obvious difference in model performance was found between near-neutral and strongly-stratiﬁed conditions. Furthermore, observed NBL regime transitions are represented in a natural way. The reference model version performs much better than a model version that applies excessive vertical mixing as is done in several (global) operational models. Model sensitivity runs showed that for weak-wind conditions the inversion strength depends much more on details of the landatmosphere coupling than on the turbulent mixing. The presented results indicate that in principle the physical parametrizations of large-scale atmospheric models are sufﬁciently equipped for modelling stably-stratiﬁed conditions for a wide range of forcing conditions.},

The single-turbine wake is strongly correlated with stability, in terms of velocity deﬁcit, turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and temperature distribution. Because of the Coriolis effect, the wake shape deviates from a Gaussian distribution. For the wind-farm simulations, the separation of the core region and outer region is clear for the stable and neutral cases, but less distinct for the unstable case. The unstable case exhibits strong horizontal variations in wind speed. Local accelerations such as related to aisle jets are also observed, whose features depend on stability. The added TKE in the wind farm increases with stability. The highest power extraction and lowest power deﬁcit are observed for the unstable case.},

	abstract = {A systematic evaluation is conducted of the smoothed spectrum, which is a spectral estimate obtained by averaging over a window of contiguous frequencies. The technique is extended to the ogive, as well as to the cross-spectrum. It is shown that, combined with existing variance estimates for the periodogram, the variance—and therefore the random error—associated with these estimates can be calculated in a straightforward way. The smoothed spectra and ogives are biased estimates; with simple power-law analytical models, correction procedures are devised, as well as a global constraint that enforces Parseval’s identity. Several new results are thus obtained: (1) The analytical variance estimates compare well with the sample variance calculated for the Bartlett spectrum and the variance of the inertial subrange of the cospectrum is shown to be relatively much larger than that of the spectrum. (2) Ogives and spectra estimates with reduced bias are calculated. (3) The bias of the smoothed spectrum and ogive is shown to be negligible at the higher frequencies. (4) The ogives and spectra thus calculated have better frequency resolution than the Bartlett spectrum, with (5) gradually increasing variance and relative error towards the low frequencies. (6) Power-law identiﬁcation and extraction of the rate of dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy are possible directly from the ogive. (7) The smoothed cross-spectrum is a valid inner product and therefore an acceptable candidate for coherence and spectral correlation coefﬁcient estimation by means of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. The quadrature, phase function, coherence function and spectral correlation function obtained from the smoothed spectral estimates compare well with the classical ones derived from the Bartlett spectrum.},

The wind waves and swell are found to affect the coupling between the water surface and the air differently. The surface-stress vector aligns with the wind velocity in the presence of wind waves, but a wide range of stress–wind misalignment angles is observed during swell. The momentum transport efﬁciency decreases when signiﬁcant stress–wind misalignment is present, suggesting a strong inﬂuence of surface wave properties on surface drag. Based on this improved understanding of the role of wave–wind misalignment, a new relative wind speed for surface-layer similarity formulations is proposed and tested using the data. The new expression yields a value of the von Kármán constant (κ) of 0.38, compared to 0.36 when using the absolute wind speed, as well as reduced data ﬁtting errors. Finally, the ratios of aerodynamic to scalar roughness lengths are computed and various existing models in the literature are tested using least-square ﬁtting to the observed ratios. The tests are able to discriminate between the performance of various models; however, they also indicate that more investigations are required to understand the physics of scalar exchanges over waves.},

Here, it is used to estimate the surface friction velocity u from the wind speed and temperature in the atmospheric surface layer (ASL). Filters of varying scale and direction are applied to wind speed and temperature in the ASL before MOST is used to estimate u . This procedure unveils the scale dependence of coupling between the ASL and the surface. Direct numerical simulation of turbulent Ekman ﬂow above a smooth surface is used to explicitly resolve the near-wall dynamics. It is found that the viscous sub-layer may cease to exist, even in continuously turbulent neutral conditions, while the ASL covers more than one decade of variation in height. An underestimation in the variance of u estimated through MOST versus its actual variance is quantiﬁed as a function of height, averaging time, and length scale. For large ﬁlter scales, the variance exhibits a purely statistical convergence—there is no signature of long-term memory beyond the scale of coherent turbulent motion. Joint convergence of u estimated by MOST and the actual u is obtained for ﬁlter scales beyond several thousand wall units, and only for data ﬁltered along both horizontal dimensions; the three-dimensional structure of the turbulence elements limits the convergence of data ﬁltered along any of the single dimensions: time, the streamwise or spanwise direction. In stably stratiﬁed conditions, MOST is found to have no or negative skill in locally estimating ASL properties from u and should therefore only be applied to ﬁltered quantities.},

	abstract = {We investigate by means of direct numerical simulation how large-scale circulations produce deviations from Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) in the limit of free convection, disentangling the role of large-scale downdrafts from updrafts using conditional analysis. We compare the convective boundary layer to two other free-convective flows: Rayleigh–Bénard convection with an adiabatic top lid and classical Rayleigh–Bénard convection. This serves a dual purpose: firstly, to ascertain how changes in the upper boundary conditions and thereby in the large-scale circulations modify the near-surface behaviour and secondly, to assess to what extent we can extrapolate results from idealized systems to the unstable atmospheric surface layer. Using a low-pass filter to define the large scales we find that, whilst deviations from MOST occur within large-scale downdraft regions, strong deviations also occur within large-scale updraft regions. The deviations within updrafts are independent of the filter length scale used to define the large-scale circulations, independent of whether updrafts are defined as ascending air, or as air that is both ascending and positively buoyant, and are not due to changes with height of the updraft area fraction. This suggests that even updraft properties are not just determined locally, but also by outer scales. Cold, strong downdrafts in classical Rayleigh–Bénard convection notably modify the near-surface behaviour compared to the other two systems. For the moderate Reynolds numbers considered, Rayleigh–Bénard convection with an adiabatic top lid thus seems more appropriate than classical Rayleigh–Bénard convection for studying the unstable atmospheric surface layer in the limit of free convection.},

	abstract = {The turbulence generated by wind shear is described at grey-zone resolutions using a theoretical neutral boundary layer based on atmospheric conditions constructed from measurements from the CASES-99 ﬁeld campaign. Six-metre-resolution large-eddy simulations (LES) are performed to access the “true” resolved turbulence for two cases, corresponding to a forcing of the boundary layer by zonal geostrophic wind speeds of 10 m s−1 and 20 m s−1. The LES ﬁelds are subject to a coarse-graining procedure in order to compute turbulence diagnostics in the grey zone, with the robustness and weakness of various averaging procedures tested, for which simple top-hat averaging is found to be both suitable and accurate. In addition, the “true” resolved and subgrid-scale ﬂuxes, variances, turbulent kinetic energy and production terms are quantiﬁed on various scales. The grey zone of turbulence is deﬁned as the range of scales where 10–90\% of turbulence is resolved, which here ranges from resolutions of 25–800 m (0.03 {\textless} x/h {\textless} 1, where x is the horizontal resolution, and h is the boundarylayer height). The subgrid/resolved partitioning of the variances of the velocity components depends on the geostrophic wind speed, which is not the case for the momentum-ﬂux partitioning. Dynamic production terms show that ﬁne-scale turbulence is isotropic ( x/h {\textless} 0.03) and is quasi one-directional, oriented in the direction of the geostrophic wind vector at the mesoscale ( x/h {\textgreater} 1). The turbulence parametrizations, which are tested in the Méso-NH model by running simulations at resolutions from the LES scale to the mesoscale, fail to produce the correct turbulence regardless of resolution.},

	abstract = {Statistical descriptions of coherent ﬂow motions in the atmospheric boundary layer have many applications in the wind engineering community. For instance, the dynamical characteristics of large-scale motions in wall turbulence play an important role in predicting the dynamical loads on buildings, or the ﬂuctuations in the power distribution across wind farms. Davenport (Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 1961, Vol. 372, 194-211) performed a seminal study on the subject and proposed a hypothesis that is still widely used to date. Here, we demonstrate how the empirical formulation of Davenport is consistent with the analysis of Baars et al. (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 2017, Vol. 823, R2) in the spirit of Townsend’s attached-eddy hypothesis in wall turbulence. We further study stratiﬁcation effects based on two-point measurements of atmospheric boundary-layer ﬂow over the Utah salt ﬂats. No self-similar scaling is observed in stable conditions, putting the application of Davenport’s framework, as well as the attached-eddy hypothesis, in question for this case. Data obtained under unstable conditions exhibit clear self-similar scaling and our analysis reveals a strong sensitivity of the statistical aspect ratio of coherent structures (deﬁned as the ratio of streamwise and wall-normal extent) to the magnitude of the stability parameter.},

	abstract = {Monin–Obukhov similarity theory is used in large-eddy simulation (LES) models as a surface boundary condition to predict the surface shear stress and scalar ﬂuxes based on the gradients between the surface and the ﬁrst grid level above the surface. We outline deﬁciencies of this methodology, such as the systematical underestimation of the surface shear stress, and propose a modiﬁed boundary condition to correct for this issue. The proposed boundary condition is applied to a set of LES for both neutral and stable boundary layers with successively decreasing grid spacing. The results indicate that the proposed boundary condition reliably corrects the surface shear stress and the sensible heat ﬂux, and improves grid convergence of these quantities. The LES data indicate improved grid convergence for the surface shear stress, more so than for the surface heat ﬂux. This is either due to a limited performance of the Monin–Obukhov similarity functions or due to problems in the LES model in representing stable conditions. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the correction achieved using the proposed boundary condition does not lead to improved grid convergence of the wind-speed and temperature proﬁles. From this we conclude that the sensitivity of the windspeed and temperature proﬁles in the LES model to the grid spacing is more likely related to under-resolved near-surface gradients and turbulent mixing at the boundary-layer top, to the SGS model formulation, and/or to numerical issues, and not to deﬁciencies due to the use of improper surface boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {An experiment to investigate atmospheric turbulence was performed at Concordia station (Dome C, Antarctica) during winter 2012, ﬁnding signiﬁcant turbulence in a near-surface layer extending to heights of a few tens of metres, despite the strong stable stratiﬁcation. The spatial and temporal behaviour of thermal turbulence is examined using a high-resolution sodar, starting from the lowest few metres with a vertical resolution better than 2 m. Sodar observations are complemented by in situ measurements using a weather station and radiometers near the surface, temperature and wind-speed sensors at six levels on a 45-m tower, and radiosondes. The depth of the surface-based turbulent layer (SBTL) at Dome C during the whole winter is directly measured experimentally for the ﬁrst time, and has an average depth of ≈ 23 m, varying from a few to several tens of metres, while the inversion-layer depth ≈ 380 m. Relationships between the depth of the SBTL and atmospheric parameters such as the temperature, wind speed, longwave radiation, Brunt–Väisälä frequency and Richardson number are shown. The SBTL under steady weather conditions is analyzed and classiﬁed into three prevailing types: (i) a very shallow layer with a depth {\textless} 15 m, (ii) a shallow layer of depth 15–70 m with uniform internal structure, (iii) a shallow layer of depth 20–70 m with waves. Wave activity in the SBTL is observed during a signiﬁcant portion of the time, with sometimes regular (with periodicity of 8–15 min) trains of Kelvin–Helmholtz billow-like waves occurring at periods of 20–60 s, and lasting several hours.},

	abstract = {Observations of two typical contrasting weakly stable and very stable boundary layers from the winter at Dome C station, Antarctica, are used as a benchmark for two centimetre-scaleresolution large-eddy simulations. By taking the Antarctic winter, the effects of the diurnal cycle are eliminated, enabling the study of the long-lived steady stable boundary layer. With its homogeneous, ﬂat snow surface, and extreme stabilities, the location is a natural laboratory for studies on the long-lived stable boundary layer. The two simulations differ only in the imposed geostrophic wind speed, which is identiﬁed as the main deciding factor for the resulting regime. In general, a good correspondence is found between the observed and simulated proﬁles of mean wind speed and temperature. Discrepancies in the temperature proﬁles are likely due to the exclusion of radiative transfer in the current simulations. The extreme stabilities result in a considerable contrast between the stable boundary layer at the Dome C site and that found at typical mid-latitudes. The boundary-layer height is found to range from approximately 50 m to just 5 m in the most extreme case. Remarkably, heating of the boundary layer by subsidence may result in thermal equilibrium of the boundary layer in which the associated heating is balanced by the turbulent cooling towards the surface. Using centimetre-scale resolutions, accurate large-eddy simulations of the extreme stabilities encountered in Antarctica appear to be possible. However, future simulations should aim to include radiative transfer and sub-surface heat transport to increase the degree of realism of these types of simulations.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) experiments have been performed using the Parallelized LES Model (PALM). A methodology for validating and understanding LES results for plume dispersion and concentration ﬂuctuations in an atmospheric-like ﬂow is presented. A wide range of grid resolutions is shown to be necessary for investigating the convergence of statistical characteristics of velocity and scalar ﬁelds. For the scalar, the statistical moments up to the fourth order and the shape of the concentration probability density function (p.d.f.) are examined. The mean concentration is inﬂuenced by grid resolution, with the highest resolution simulation showing a lower mean concentration, linked to larger turbulent structures. However, a clear tendency to convergence of the concentration variance is observed at the two higher resolutions. This behaviour is explained by showing that the mechanisms driving the mean and the variance are differently inﬂuenced by the grid resolution. The analysis of skewness and kurtosis allows also the obtaining of general results on plume concentration ﬂuctuations. Irrespective of grid resolution, a family of Gamma p.d.f.s well represents the shape of the concentration p.d.f. but only beyond the peak of the concentration ﬂuctuation intensity. In the early plume dispersion phases, the moments of the p.d.f. are in good agreement with those generated by a ﬂuctuating plume model. To the best of our knowledge, our study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that, if resolution and averaging time are adequate, atmospheric LES provides a trustworthy representation of the high order moments of the concentration ﬁeld, up to the fourth order, for a dispersing plume.},

This model intercomparison focuses on the very stable stratification encountered over the Antarctic Plateau in 2009. Here, we analyze results from 10 large-eddy-simulation (LES) codes for different spatial resolutions over 24 consecutive hours, and compare them with observations acquired at the Concordia Research Station during summer. This is a challenging exercise for such simulations since they need to reproduce both the 300-m-deep convective boundary layer and the very thin stable boundary layer characterized by a strong vertical temperature gradient (10 K difference over the lowest 20 m) when the sun is low over the horizon. A large variability in surface fluxes among the different models is highlighted. The LES models correctly reproduce the convective boundary layer in terms of mean profiles and turbulent characteristics but display more spread during stable conditions, which is largely reduced by increasing the horizontal and vertical resolutions in additional simulations focusing only on the stable period. This highlights the fact that very fine resolution is needed to represent such conditions. Complementary sensitivity studies are conducted regarding the roughness length, the subgrid-scale turbulence closure as well as the resolution and domain size. While we find little dependence on the surface-flux parametrization, the results indicate a pronounced sensitivity to both the roughness length and the turbulence closure.},

Each cubical complex is deﬁned as a set of grid cells that have the same sign of vertical velocity, either positive or negative. Low-order topological invariants, namely the Betti numbers of the cubical complexes, are found to capture key aspects of the boundary-layer organization and evolution over the diurnal cycle. An unsupervised-learning algorithm is trained using the topological invariants in order to classify the spatio–temporal evolution of convection over a whole day. The successful classiﬁcation of the CBL by using this approach illustrates the potential of such simpliﬁed representation of turbulent ﬂow for data reduction and boundarylayer parametrization approaches.},

We survey methods to eliminate non-stationary records or partially ﬁlter out the non-stationarity. We also summarize issues with parametrization of the non-stationarity.

The proposed function may be matched with the currently accepted universal functions for the dimensionless wind-speed and temperature gradients using the empirical coefﬁcients a and b to yield differences within ± 14\% for both wind and temperature gradients in the interval of −2 {\textless} z/L {\textless} 0.5 (z is height and L is the Obukhov length). In neutral conditions, wind and temperature proﬁles are the same as the standard log-law proﬁle. Under unstable conditions, the differences are smaller than 1.5\%; conversely, under stable conditions, the differences reach up to − 5.2\%. The coefﬁcients a and b are analyzed here to evaluate the limits of this proposed semi-empirical function and possible physical characteristics are discussed. Although we use the same theoretical assumptions and limitations of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory in the surface layer, the proposed function has the ﬂexibility of adjusting the wind and temperature gradients for speciﬁc sites using the empirical coefﬁcients a and b within the range 0–1, with stable and unstable conditions able to be described by a single general function.},

	abstract = {Physical processes represented by the Monin–Obukhov bulk formula for momentum are investigated with ﬁeld observations. We discuss important differences between turbulent mixing by the most energetic non-local, large, coherent turbulence eddies and local turbulent mixing as traditionally represented by K-theory (analog to molecular diffusion), especially in consideration of developing surface-layer stratiﬁcation. The study indicates that the neutral state in a horizontally homogeneous surface layer described in the Monin–Obukhov bulk formula represents a special neutrality regardless of wind speed, for example, the surface layer with no surface heating/cooling. Under this situation, the Monin–Obukhov bulk formula agrees well with observations for heights to at least 30 m. As the surface layer is stratiﬁed, stably or unstably, the neutral state is achieved by mechanically generated turbulent mixing through the most energetic non-local coherent eddies. The observed neutral relationship between u∗ (the square root of the momentum ﬂux magnitude) and wind speed V at any height is different from that described by the Monin–Obukhov formula except within several metres of the surface. The deviation of the Monin–Obukhov neutral u∗−V linear relation from the observed one increases with height and contributes to the deteriorating performance of the bulk formula with increasing height, which cannot be compensated by stability functions. Based on these analyses, estimation of drag coefﬁcients is discussed as well.},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These “decadal predictions” are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive. For researchers unfamiliar with climate models, the limitations of the models and experiment design are described.},

            Since the advent of computers midway through the twentieth century, computational resources have increased exponentially. It is likely they will continue to do so, especially when accounting for recent trends in multicore processors. History has shown that such an increase tends to directly lead to weather and climate models that readily exploit the extra resources, improving model quality and resolution. We show that Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) models that utilize modern, accelerated (e.g., by GPU or coprocessor), parallel hardware systems can now provide turbulence-resolving numerical weather forecasts over a region the size of the Netherlands at 100-m resolution. This approach has the potential to speed the development of turbulence-resolving numerical weather prediction models.},

            Most activities of humankind take place in the transition zone between four compartments of the terrestrial system: the unconfined aquifer, including the unsaturated zone; surface water; vegetation; and atmosphere. The mass, momentum, and heat energy fluxes between these compartments drive their mutual state evolution. Improved understanding of the processes that drive these fluxes is important for climate projections, weather prediction, flood forecasting, water and soil resources management, agriculture, and water quality control. The different transport mechanisms and flow rates within the compartments result in complex patterns on different temporal and spatial scales that make predictions of the terrestrial system challenging for scientists and policy makers. The Transregional Collaborative Research Centre 32 (TR32) was formed in 2007 to integrate monitoring with modeling and data assimilation in order to develop a holistic view of the terrestrial system. TR32 is a long-term research program funded by the German national science foundation Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), in order to focus and integrate research activities of several universities on an emerging scientific topic of high societal relevance. Aiming to bridge the gap between microscale soil pores and catchment-scale atmospheric variables, TR32 unites research groups from the German universities of Aachen, Bonn, and Cologne, and from the environmental and geoscience departments of Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH. Here, we report about recent achievements in monitoring and modeling of the terrestrial system, including the development of new observation techniques for the subsurface, the establishment of cross-scale, multicompartment modeling platforms from the pore to the catchment scale, and their use to investigate the propagation of patterns in the state and structure of the subsurface to the atmospheric boundary layer.},

            The last decade has seen the success of stochastic parameterizations in short-term, medium-range, and seasonal forecasts: operational weather centers now routinely use stochastic parameterization schemes to represent model inadequacy better and to improve the quantification of forecast uncertainty. Developed initially for numerical weather prediction, the inclusion of stochastic parameterizations not only provides better estimates of uncertainty, but it is also extremely promising for reducing long-standing climate biases and is relevant for determining the climate response to external forcing. This article highlights recent developments from different research groups that show that the stochastic representation of unresolved processes in the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and cryosphere of comprehensive weather and climate models 1) gives rise to more reliable probabilistic forecasts of weather and climate and 2) reduces systematic model bias. We make a case that the use of mathematically stringent methods for the derivation of stochastic dynamic equations will lead to substantial improvements in our ability to accurately simulate weather and climate at all scales. Recent work in mathematics, statistical mechanics, and turbulence is reviewed; its relevance for the climate problem is demonstrated; and future research directions are outlined.},

They have important impacts on both radiative and turbulent heat ﬂuxes and partly determine local climate-change feedbacks. Understanding the spread in inversion strength modelled by current global climate models is therefore an important step in better understanding Arctic climate and its present and future changes. Here, we show how the formation of Arctic air masses leads to the emergence of a cloudy and a clear state of the Arctic winter boundary layer. In the cloudy state, cloud liquid water is present, little to no surface radiative cooling occurs and inversions are elevated and relatively weak, whereas surface radiative cooling leads to strong surface-based temperature inversions in the clear state. Comparing model output to observations, we ﬁnd that most climate models lack a realistic representation of the cloudy state. An idealised single-column model experiment of the formation of Arctic air reveals that this bias is linked to inadequate mixedphase cloud microphysics, whereas turbulent and conductive heat ﬂuxes control the strength of inversions within the clear state.},

	abstract = {Investigation of stably stratiﬁed turbulent ﬂows in the atmosphere is challenging owing to its nonstationarity and heterogeneity, especially in very stable conditions. In recent years, numerical simulation has become a powerful tool to complement the understanding of fundamental characteristics of strongly stratiﬁed ﬂows. Owing to its highly accurate representation of small-scale turbulence structures, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is shown to be the most effective numerical approach for strongly stratiﬁed ﬂows. However, due to the limitation of the traditional parallel strategy, existing DNS studies on stratiﬁed channel ﬂows are limited to relatively low Reynolds numbers. In order to make the DNS studies more relevant to the atmospheric boundary layer ﬂows, in this paper, a high-order ﬁnite-difference DNS solver is developed for simulating stably stratiﬁed turbulent channel ﬂows at relatively high Reynolds numbers. Utilizing the advanced two dimensional domain decomposition technique, the DNS solver is shown to be competent for petascale simulations with excellent scalability tested up to 32,768 CPU cores. Using this newly developed solver, two stably stratiﬁed open-channel simulations are conducted with the highest Reynolds number being approximately 105. The fundamental characteristics of strongly stratiﬁed turbulent ﬂows, e.g., spatio-temporal variation of global intermittency, are compared with those previously reported at relatively low Reynolds numbers, and their similarities and discrepancies are also discussed. In addition, the DNS-based Monin–Obukhov similarity relationships are compared with those proposed based on observational data to evaluate their relevance to atmospheric ﬂows.

	abstract = {Integrated hydrologic models coupled to land surface models require several input parameters to characterize the land surface and to estimate energy ﬂuxes. Uncertainty of input parameter values is inherent in any model and the sensitivity of output to these uncertain parameters becomes an important consideration. To better understand these connections in the context of hydrologic models, we use the ParFlow-Common Land Model (PF-CLM) to estimate energy ﬂuxes given variations in 19 vegetation and land surface parameters over a 144-hour period of time. Latent, sensible and ground heat ﬂuxes from bare soil and grass vegetation were estimated using single column and tilted-v domains. Energy ﬂux outputs, along with the corresponding input parameters, from each of the four scenario simulations were evaluated using active subspaces. The active subspace method considers parameter sensitivity by quantifying a weight for each parameter. The method also evaluates the potential for dimension reduction by identifying the input–output relationship through the active variable – a linear combination of input parameters. The aerodynamic roughness length was the most important parameter for bare soil energy ﬂuxes. Multiple parameters were important for energy ﬂuxes from vegetated surfaces and depended on the type of energy ﬂux. Relationships between land surface inputs and output ﬂuxes varied between latent, sensible and ground heat, but were consistent between domain setup (i.e., with or without lateral ﬂow) and vegetation type. A quadratic polynomial was used to describe the input–output relationship for these energy ﬂuxes. The reduced-dimension model of land surface dynamics can be compared to observations or used to solve the inverse problem. Considering this work as a proof-ofconcept, the active subspace method can be applied and extended to a range of domain setups, land cover types and time periods to obtain a reduced-form representation of any output of interest, provided that an active subspace exists.},

A promising approach is the LES WALE model, which can be used without wall functions or global damping functions. The model produces an efficient and fast scheme due to its algebraic character. Additionally, its prediction of the transition from laminar to turbulent regimes has shown promising results. In this work, the LES WALE model is investigated within the lattice Boltzmann framework. For validation purposes, various test cases are presented. First, a channel flow at a Reynolds number of 6876 is investigated. Secondly, the flow around a wall-mounted cube at various Reynolds numbers is determined. The flow regime varies from laminar, to transitional, to fully turbulent conditions at a Reynolds number of 40,000 with respect to the cube height.},

	abstract = {Recent contributions to second-order turbulence modelling are reviewed with an emphasis on models of the coastal ocean. Classical and recent turbulence models are reformulated using a unifying notation, making differences in model structure and model parameters more transparent. The essential characteristics of a number of models are compared. It is further demonstrated that the mathematical stability and realisability of the models is crucial for practical applications. The parameter constraints to insure stable computations are discussed. Model performance is evaluated for a number of idealised entrainment scenarios that are typical for shelf seas: entrainment in linearly stratiﬁed and twolayer ﬂuids caused by (a) surface wind stress (b) bottom stress due to water motion driven by a barotropic pressure gradient (c) bottom stress due to water motion in a bottom jet. It is shown that the predicted entrainment velocities are in good agreement with available laboratory data, provided the models have been calibrated according to a theoretical constraint. In addition, model behaviour in free convection is re-analysed with the help of recent data from large eddy simulations (LES). It is shown that even the most simple models, which do not solve a differential equation for the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), can approximately reproduce the entrainment depth, however, they fail completely in reproducing the correct budget of the TKE-balance. In contrast, second-order models solving transport equations for the TKE and a length scale determining variable are in reasonable agreement with the TKE-budgets from LES.},

In practice, curves data are usually collected in a discrete form and hence they must be pre-processed to use purely functional techniques. However, in the context of k-sample tests, the pre-processing step can have effects in terms of power reduction. Hall and Van Keilegom (Stat Sin 17:1511–1531, 2007) proposed a methodology to minimizing these effects in the context of tests for the equality of two distribution functions. Their procedure is here extended to the case of k-sample hypothesis tests. The asymptotic validity of the procedure is established and its ﬁnite sample performance is analyzed through Monte Carlo experiments. As an illustration, the method is applied to air quality data collected from several monitoring stations placed at different geographical locations at the center of Spain.},

While the impact of roughness on the mean-velocity proﬁle of turbulent wall layers is well understood, at least qualitatively, the manner in which other features are affected, especially in the outer layer, has been more controversial. We compare results from the smooth- and rough-wall sides of the channel for three different roughness heights of h+ = 5.4, 10.8, and 21.6 for Reτ of 400, to isolate the effects of the roughness on turbulent statistics and the instantaneous turbulence structure at large and small scales. We focus on the interaction between the near-wall and outer-layer regions, in particular the extent to which the near-wall behavior inﬂuences the ﬂow further away from the surface. Roughness tends to increase the intensity of the velocity and vorticity ﬂuctuations in the inner layer. In the outer layer, although the roughness alters the velocity ﬂuctuations, the vorticity ﬂuctuations are relatively unaffected. The higher-order moments and the energy budgets demonstrate signiﬁcant differences between the smooth-wall and rough-wall sides in the processes associated with the wall-normal ﬂuxes of the Reynolds shear stresses and turbulence kinetic energy. The length scales and ﬂow dynamics in the roughness sublayer, the spatially inhomogeneous layer within which the ﬂow is directly inﬂuenced by the individual roughness elements, are also examined. Alternative mechanisms involved in producing and maintaining near-wall turbulence in rough-wall boundary layers are also considered. We ﬁnd that the strength of the inner/outer-layer interactions are greatly affected by the size of the roughness elements.},

Turbulence is parameterized by first-order closure and the surface heat flux is prescribed, together with the wind speed and temperature at the model top. To study the collapse phenomenon both numerical simulations and linear stability analysis are used. The stability analysis is nonclassical in a sense that the stability of a parameterized set of equations of a turbulent flow is analyzed instead of a particular laminar flow solution. The analytical theory predicts a collapse of turbulence when a certain critical value of the stability parameter δ/L (typically O(0.5–1)) is exceeded, with δ the depth of the channel and L the Obukhov length. The exact critical value depends on channel roughness to depth ratio z0/δ. The analytical predictions are validated by the numerical simulations, and good agreement is found. As such, for the flow configuration considered, the present framework provides both a tool and a physical explanation for the collapse phenomenon.},

Many physical processes come into play in the stable boundary layer (SBL), i.e., turbulence, radiation, land surface coupling and heterogeneity, orographic turbulent and gravity wave drag (GWD). The development of robust stable boundary-layer parameterizations for weather and climate models is difﬁcult because of the multiplicity of processes and their complex interactions. As a result, these models suffer from biases in key variables, such as the 2-m temperature, boundary-layer depth and wind speed. This short paper brieﬂy summarizes the state-of-the-art of SBL research, and highlights physical processes that received only limited attention so far, in particular orographically-induced GWD, longwave radiation divergence, and the land-atmosphere coupling over a snow-covered surface. Finally, a conceptual framework with relevant processes and particularly their interactions is proposed.},

The underlying concept is similar to that of a hot wire anemometer extended in space. The correlation coefﬁcient between U measured by two colocated sonic anemometers and the AHFO were 0.91 during the day and 0.87 at night. The combination of classical passive and novel AHFO provides unprecedented dynamic observations of both air temperature and wind speed spanning 4 orders of magnitude in spatial scale (0.1–1000 m) while resolving individual turbulent motions, opening new opportunities for testing basic theories for near-surface geophysical ﬂows.},

In a coupled SBL, large turbulent eddies enhance cross-layer mixing and vertically well-mixed turbulent kinetic energy. However, large gradients in momentum and heat fluxes are frequently observed, degrading the performance of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. It is shown that increased vertical gradients of mean variables (i.e., wind speed and potential temperature) can cause flux gradients. This process is operated upon by downward penetrating large eddies with altered phase difference, contributing unevenly to fluxes and thus causing flux gradients. In the coupled SBL with small gradients in mean variables, large eddies are vertically synchronized, contributing evenly to fluxes across layers and thus causing small flux gradients. As turbulent production becomes weak and the cross-layer difference in turbulent flux transport increases, large eddies become less vertically synchronized, contributing unevenly to fluxes across layers and thus causing large flux gradients.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Continental-scale hyper-resolution simulations constitute a grand challenge in characterizing nonlinear feedbacks of states and fluxes of the coupled water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles of terrestrial systems. Tackling this challenge requires advanced coupling and supercomputing technologies for earth system models that are discussed in this study, utilizing the example of the implementation of the newly developed Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP v1.0) on JUQUEEN (IBM Blue Gene/Q) of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre, Germany. The applied coupling strategies rely on the Multiple Program Multiple Data (MPMD) paradigm using the OASIS suite of external couplers, and require memory and load balancing considerations in the exchange of the coupling fields between different component models and the allocation of computational resources, respectively. Using the advanced profiling and tracing tool Scalasca to determine an optimum load balancing leads to a 19\% speedup. In massively parallel supercomputer environments, the coupler OASIS-MCT is recommended, which resolves memory limitations that may be significant in case of very large computational domains and exchange fields as they occur in these specific test cases and in many applications in terrestrial research. However, model I/O and initialization in the petascale range still require major attention, as they constitute true big data challenges in light of future exascale computing resources. Based on a factor-two speedup due to compiler optimizations, a refactored coupling interface using OASIS-MCT and an optimum load balancing, the problem size in a weak scaling study can be increased by a factor of 64 from 512 to 32 768 processes while maintaining parallel efficiencies above 80\% for the component models.},

With the implementation of MXL in MESSy, MXL can be used in combination with other MESSy submodels that represent processes related to atmospheric chemistry. For instance, the coupling of MXL with more advanced modules for gas-phase chemistry (such as the Mainz Isoprene Mechanism 2 (MIM2)), emissions, dry deposition and organic aerosol formation than in previous versions of the MXL code is possible.

	abstract = {A radiatively driven cloud-top mixing layer is investigated using direct numerical simulations. This conﬁguration mimics the mixing process across the inversion that bounds the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer. The main focus of this paper is on small-scale turbulence. The ﬁnest resolution (7.4 cm) is about two orders of magnitude ﬁner than that in cloud large-eddy simulations (LES). A one-dimensional horizontally averaged model is employed for the radiation. The results show that the deﬁnition of the inversion point with the mean buoyancy of hbi(zi) 5 0 leads to convective turbulent scalings in the cloud bulk consistent with the Deardorff theory. Three mechanisms contribute to the entrainment by cooling the inversion layer: a molecular ﬂux, a turbulent ﬂux, and the direct radiative cooling by the smoke inside the inversion layer. In the simulations the molecular ﬂux is negligible, but the direct cooling reaches values comparable to the turbulent ﬂux as the inversion layer thickens. The results suggest that the direct cooling might be overestimated in lessresolved models like LES, resulting in an excessive entrainment. The scaled turbulent ﬂux is independent of the stratiﬁcation for the range of Richardson numbers studied here. As suggested by earlier studies, the turbulent entrainment only occurs at the small scales and eddies larger than approximately four optical lengths (60 m in a typical stratocumulus cloud) perform little or no entrainment. Based on those results, a parameterization is proposed that accounts for a large part (50\%–100\%) of the entrainment velocities measured in the Second Dynamics and Chemistry of the Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS II) campaign.},

It employs the Monin–Obukhov length as a length scale in both the horizontal and vertical directions, in contrast to the original Monin–Obukhov similarity. Therefore, the horizontal turbulence scales, which are contained in multipoint statistics, must be explicitly included. The similarity hypothesis is formulated for the joint probability density function (JPDF) of multipoint velocity and temperature differences and is termed the multipoint Monin–Obukhov similarity (MMO). In MMO, the nondimensional JPDF in the surface layer depends on the separation vectors and the heights from the ground, both nondimensionalized by the Monin–Obukhov length. A key aspect of MMO is that at heights much smaller than the absolute value of the Monin–Obukhov length, both shear and buoyancy can be important. As an application, MMO is used to predict the two-dimensional horizontal turbulence spectra in the convective surface layer. It predicts a two-layer structure with three scaling ranges. Comparisons of the predicted spectra with those obtained using high-resolution large-eddy simulations show general agreement, supporting MMO. Within MMO, full similarity is only achieved for multipoint statistics, while similarity properties (or a lack thereof) for one-point statistics (the original Monin–Obukhov similarity) can be derived from those of multipoint statistics. MMO provides a new framework for analyzing the turbulence statistics and for understanding the dynamics in the atmospheric surface layer.},

	abstract = {The new double-moment microphysics scheme described in Part I of this paper is implemented into a single-column model to simulate clouds and radiation observed during the period 1 April–15 May 1998 of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) and First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) Regional Experiment–Arctic Clouds Experiment (FIRE–ACE) field projects. Mean predicted cloud boundaries and total cloud fraction compare reasonably well with observations. Cloud phase partitioning, which is crucial in determining the surface radiative fluxes, is fairly similar to ground-based retrievals. However, the fraction of time that liquid is present in the column is somewhat underpredicted, leading to small biases in the downwelling shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes at the surface. Results using the new scheme are compared to parallel simulations using other microphysics parameterizations of varying complexity. The predicted liquid water path and cloud phase is significantly improved using the new scheme relative to a single-moment parameterization predicting only the mixing ratio of the water species. Results indicate that a realistic treatment of cloud ice number concentration (prognosing rather than diagnosing) is needed to simulate arctic clouds. Sensitivity tests are also performed by varying the aerosol size, solubility, and number concentration to explore potential cloud–aerosol–radiation interactions in arctic stratus.},

The microphysics scheme predicts the number concentrations and mixing ratios of four hydrometeor species (cloud droplets, small ice, rain, snow) and includes detailed treatments of droplet activation and ice nucleation from a prescribed distribution of aerosol obtained from observations. The model is able to reproduce many features of the observed mixed-phase cloud, including a near-adiabatic liquid water content profile located near the top of a well-mixed boundary layer, droplet number concentrations of about 200–250 cmϪ3 that were distributed fairly uniformly through the depth of the cloud, and continuous light snow falling from the cloud base to the surface. The impacts of droplet and ice nucleation, radiative transfer, turbulence, large-scale dynamics, and vertical resolution on the simulated mixed-phase stratiform cloud are examined. The cloud layer is largely self-maintained through strong cloud-top radiative cooling that exceeds 40 K dayϪ1. It persists through extended periods of downward large-scale motion that tend to thin the layer and reduce water contents. Droplet activation rates are highest near cloud base, associated with subgrid vertical motion that is diagnosed from the predicted turbulence kinetic energy. A sensitivity test neglecting subgrid vertical velocity produces only weak activation and small droplet number concentrations (Ͻ90 cmϪ3). These results highlight the importance of parameterizing the impact of subgrid vertical velocity to generate local supersaturation for aerosol-droplet closure. The primary ice nucleation mode in the simulated mixed-phase cloud is contact freezing of droplets. Sensitivity tests indicate that the assumed number and size of contact nuclei can have a large impact on the evolution and characteristics of mixed-phase cloud, especially the partitioning of condensate between droplets and ice.},

The initial data and forcings for this case placed it in an interesting part of parameter space, near the boundary where cloud-top mixing is thought to render the cloud layer unstable on the one hand, or tending toward a decoupled structure on the other hand. The basis of this evaluation consists of sixteen 4-h simulations from 10 modeling centers over grids whose vertical spacing was 5 m at the cloud-top interface and whose horizontal spacing was 35 m. Extensive sensitivity studies of both the configuration of the case and the numerical setup also enhanced the analysis. Overall it was found that (i) if efforts are made to reduce spurious mixing at cloud top, either by refining the vertical grid or limiting the effects of the subgrid model in this region, then the observed turbulent and thermodynamic structure of the layer can be reproduced with some fidelity; (ii) the base, or native configuration of most simulations greatly overestimated mixing at cloud top, tending toward a decoupled layer in which cloud liquid water path and turbulent intensities were grossly underestimated; (iii) the sensitivity of the simulations to the representation of mixing at cloud top is, to a certain extent, amplified by particulars of this case. Overall the results suggest that the use of LESs to map out the behavior of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer in this interesting region of parameter space requires a more compelling representation of processes at cloud top. In the absence of significant leaps in the understanding of subgrid-scale (SGS) physics, such a representation can only be achieved by a significant refinement in resolution—a refinement that, while conceivable given existing resources, is probably still beyond the reach of most centers.},

	abstract = {In the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting Model (ARW), versions 3.0 and earlier, advection of scalars was performed using the Runge–Kutta time-integration scheme with an option of using a positive-deﬁnite (PD) ﬂux limiter. Large-eddy simulations of aerosol–cloud interactions using the ARW model are performed to evaluate the advection schemes. The basic Runge–Kutta scheme alone produces spurious oscillations and negative values in scalar mixing ratios because of numerical dispersion errors. The PD ﬂux limiter assures positive deﬁniteness but retains the oscillations with an ampliﬁcation of local maxima by up to 20\% in the tests. These numerical dispersion errors contaminate active scalars directly through the advection process and indirectly through physical and dynamical feedbacks, leading to a misrepresentation of cloud physical and dynamical processes. A monotonic ﬂux limiter is introduced to correct the generally accurate but dispersive solutions given by high-order Runge–Kutta scheme. The monotonic limiter effectively minimizes the dispersion errors with little signiﬁcant enhancement of numerical diffusion errors. The improvement in scalar advection using the monotonic limiter is discussed in the context of how the different advection schemes impact the quantiﬁcation of aerosol–cloud interactions. The PD limiter results in 20\% (10\%) fewer cloud droplets and 22\% (5\%) smaller cloud albedo than the monotonic limiter under clean (polluted) conditions. Underprediction of cloud droplet number concentration by the PD limiter tends to trigger the early formation of precipitation in the clean case, leading to a potentially large impact on cloud albedo change.},

	abstract = {As computing capabilities expand, operational and research environments are moving toward the use of ﬁnescale atmospheric numerical models. These models are attractive for users who seek an accurate description of small-scale turbulent motions. One such numerical tool is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which has been extensively used in synoptic-scale and mesoscale studies. As ﬁner-resolution simulations become more desirable, it remains a question whether the model features originally designed for the simulation of larger-scale atmospheric ﬂows will translate to adequate reproductions of small-scale motions. In this study, turbulent ﬂow in the dry atmospheric convective boundary layer (CBL) is simulated using a conventional large-eddy-simulation (LES) code and the WRF model applied in an LES mode. The two simulation conﬁgurations use almost identical numerical grids and are initialized with the same idealized vertical proﬁles of wind velocity, temperature, and moisture. The respective CBL forcings are set equal and held constant. The effects of the CBL wind shear and of the varying grid spacings are investigated. Horizontal slices of velocity ﬁelds are analyzed to enable a comparison of CBL ﬂow patterns obtained with each simulation method. Two-dimensional velocity spectra are used to characterize the planar turbulence structure. One-dimensional velocity spectra are also calculated. Results show that the WRF model tends to attribute slightly more energy to larger-scale ﬂow structures as compared with the CBL structures reproduced by the conventional LES. Consequently, the WRF model reproduces relatively less spatial variability of the velocity ﬁelds. Spectra from the WRF model also feature narrower inertial spectral subranges and indicate enhanced damping of turbulence on small scales.},

The unsteady version of the problem, which occurs when these forces are not in equilibrium, is solvable analytically only for a limited set of forcing variability regimes, and the resulting solutions are intricate and not always easy to interpret. In this paper, large-eddy simulations (LESs) of neutral atmospheric EBLs are conducted under various unsteady forcings to reveal the range of physical characteristics of the ﬂow. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that the dynamics of the unsteady EBL can be reduced to a second-order ordinary differential equation that is very similar to the dynamical equation of a damped oscillator, such as a mass–spring–damper system. The validation of the proposed reduced model is performed by comparing its analytical solutions to LES results, revealing very good agreement. The reduced model can be solved for a wide range of variable forcing conditions, and this feature is exploited in the paper to elucidate the physical origin of the inertia (mass), energy storage (spring), and energy dissipation (damper) attributes of Ekman ﬂows.},

	abstract = {In pursuit of a possible active feedback turbulence control method utilizing a ¯exible wall, a simple oscillatory mode of wall deformation is tested in a turbulent channel ¯ow using direct numerical simulation. The deformation is uniform in the streamwise direction and spatio-temporally sinusoidal, and its parametric conditions are determined with reference to the mean spatio-temporal scales of the quasi-coherent turbulent structures. The eects of the wall deformation on the skin friction as well as on the statistical quantities and turbulent structures are studied. Among the parameters of the wall deformation, the spanwise wavelength and gradient are more eective for the alterations of the skin friction and statistical quantities. The scales of turbulent structures are found to be dependent on the spanwise wavelength of the wall deformation at both their enhanced and damped phases, whereas a spanwise shift of these structures is observed to be correlated with the time period of deformation. The production of turbulent structures becomes highly intermittent on imposing the wall deformation condition, which is similar to that observed in the temporal evolution of the skin friction coecient as its long-period ¯uctuation.

The thickness of the mixed layer is reduced by the outer layer stratiﬁcation.

A resolved LES and a near-wall model LES (NWM–LES) both compare reasonably well with the DNS when the thermal ﬁeld is treated as a passive scalar. When buoyancy eﬀects are included, the LES mean velocity and temperature proﬁles also agree well with the DNS. However, the NWM–LES does not suﬃciently account for the overturning scales responsible for entrainment at the top of the mixed layer. As a result, the turbulent heat ﬂux and the rate of change of the mixed layer temperature are signiﬁcantly underestimated in the NWM–LES. In order to accurately simulate the boundary layer growth, the motions responsible for entrainment must either be resolved or more accurately represented in improved subgrid-scale models.},

	abstract = {An e cient numerical method to solve the unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is developed. A fully implicit time advancement is employed to avoid the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy restriction, where the Crank–Nicolson discretization is used for both the di usion and convection terms. Based on a block LU decomposition, velocity–pressure decoupling is achieved in conjunction with the approximate factorization. The main emphasis is placed on the additional decoupling of the intermediate velocity components with only nth time step velocity. The temporal second-order accuracy is preserved with the approximate factorization without any modiÿcation of boundary conditions. Since the decoupled momentum equations are solved without iteration, the computational time is reduced signiÿcantly. The present decoupling method is validated by solving several test cases, in particular, the turbulent minimal channel ow unit. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Decadal trends are also apparent in the historical record of the NAO and may be due to either stochastic or deterministic processes. Evidence is presented that suggests the NAO exhibits ‘long-range’ dependence having winter values residually correlated over many years. Several simple stochastic models have been used to fit the NAO SLP (sea-level pressure) wintertime index over the period 1864 – 1998, and their performance at predicting the following year has been assessed.

	abstract = {The land surface is a key component of climate models. It controls the partitioning of available energy at the surface between sensible and latent heat, and it controls the partitioning of available water between evaporation and runoff. The land surface is also the location of the terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence is increasing that the inﬂuence of the land surface is signiﬁcant on climate and that changes in the land surface can inﬂuence regional- to global-scale climate on time scales from days to millennia. Further, there is now a suggestion that the terrestrial carbon sink may decrease as global temperatures increase as a consequence of rising CO2 levels. This paper provides the theoretical background that explains why the land surface should play a central role in climate. It also provides evidence, sourced from climate model experiments, that the land surface is of central importance. This paper then reviews the development of land surface models designed for climate models from the early, very simple models through to recent efforts, which include a coupling of biophysical processes to represent carbon exchange. It is pointed out that signiﬁcant problems remain to be addressed, including the difﬁculties in parameterizing hydrological processes, root processes, sub-grid-scale heterogeneity and biogeochemical cycles. It is argued that continued development of land surface models requires more multidisciplinary efforts by scientists with a wide range of skills. However, it is also argued that the framework is now in place within the international community to build and maintain the latest generation of land surface models. Further, there should be considerable optimism that consolidating the recent rapid advances in land surface modelling will enhance our capability to simulate the impacts of land-cover change and the impacts of increasing CO2 on the global and regional environment.

	abstract = {The planetary boundary layer (PBL), which directly interacts with the underlying surface, differs significantly in its nature from the low turbulent stably stratified free atmosphere. Fluctuations of the Earth’s surface heat balance immediately affect the PBL and assimilate there owing to the effective mechanism of turbulent heat transfer. In this case the upper boundary of the PBL plays the role of a cover, preventing the direct penetration of thermal effects and contaminants into an overlying atmospheric layer. In view of this, air pollution is especially dangerous when associated with shallow PBL. In addition, local peculiarities of climate change are mainly determined by the PBL height due to the high sensitivity of thin stably stratified PBLs to the thermal effects. Deep convective PBLs are not very sensitive to weak thermal effects, but they significantly affect the formation of convective cloudiness and the climate system as a whole by means of the turbulent entrainment of the thermal energy, humidity, aerosols, and other admixtures through the upper boundary. The PBL height and turbulent entrainment must be calculated when simulating and forecasting air pollution, abnormal frosts and heat, and other hazardous phenomena. In this paper we discuss the state of the art knowledge in the area of PBL height simulation and suggest a new model of turbulent entrainment for con vective PBLs.},

As described in Part I, the land surface model includes explicit soil moisture, which is based on the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere (ISBA) model, and three pathways for evaporation: soil evaporation, evaporation from the wet canopy, and vegetative transpiration. The data assimilation scheme presented here also follows similar work on data assimilation for ISBA and uses model biases of the 2-m air temperature and humidity against observed analyses to nudge soil moisture. An important difference from the ISBA schemes is that the nudging strengths are computed from model parameters such as solar radiation, temperature, leaf area, vegetation coverage, and aerodynamic resistance rather than from statistically derived functions. The rationale is that nudging soil moisture according to model biases in air temperature and humidity should depend on the degree of coupling across the land–atmosphere interface. Thus, nudging strengths are designed to reﬂect the potential for the surface and root-zone soil moisture to affect near-surface air temperature and humidity. Model test cases are used to examine relationships between the nudging strengths and modeled physical parameters and then to demonstrate the effects of the nudging scheme on model results.},

In addition, it has been in use in a mesoscale meteorological model for several years. For stable conditions, a very simple scheme is presented that compares well to the iterative solution. The stable scheme includes a very stable regime in which the slope of the stability functions is reduced to permit significant fluxes to occur, which is particularly important for numerical models in which decoupling from the surface can be an important problem. For unstable conditions, simple schemes generalized for varying ratios of aerodynamic roughness to thermal roughness (z0/z0h) are less satisfactory. Therefore, a simple scheme has been empirically derived for a fixed z0/z0h ratio, which represents quasi-laminar sublayer resistance.},

	abstract = {The modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer during convective conditions has long been a major source of uncertainty in the numerical modeling of meteorological conditions and air quality. Much of the difficulty stems from the large range of turbulent scales that are effective in the convective boundary layer (CBL). Both small-scale turbulence that is subgrid in most mesoscale grid models and large-scale turbulence extending to the depth of the CBL are important for the vertical transport of atmospheric properties and chemical species. Eddy diffusion schemes assume that all of the turbulence is subgrid and therefore cannot realistically simulate convective conditions. Simple nonlocal closure PBL models, such as the Blackadar convective model that has been a mainstay PBL option in the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) for many years and the original asymmetric convective model (ACM), also an option in MM5, represent large-scale transport driven by convective plumes but neglect small-scale, subgrid turbulent mixing. A new version of the ACM (ACM2) has been developed that includes the nonlocal scheme of the original ACM combined with an eddy diffusion scheme. Thus, the ACM2 is able to represent both the supergrid- and subgrid-scale components of turbulent transport in the convective boundary layer. Testing the ACM2 in one-dimensional form and comparing it with large-eddy simulations and field data from the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere–Surface Exchange Study demonstrates that the new scheme accurately simulates PBL heights, profiles of fluxes and mean quantities, and surface-level values. The ACM2 performs equally well for both meteorological parameters (e.g., potential temperature, moisture variables, and winds) and trace chemical concentrations, which is an advantage over eddy diffusion models that include a nonlocal term in the form of a gradient adjustment.},

	abstract = {This study examines the spatial variation of the wind ﬁeld observed in the coastal zone of southeast Korea with its complex terrain, using measurements from a regional network 75 km across and centered about Busan. Results are compared with observations from an inland regional network centered around Daegu, Korea, with less dramatic, but still signiﬁcant, surface heterogeneity. The coherency between stations is examined in terms of the between-station correlations of the wind components for all pairs of stations as a function of separation distance between stations. A mesovelocity scale is deﬁned as a measure of the spatial variability of the wind ﬁeld within the network. This variability is related to wind speed and cloud cover for the two contrasting regional networks. Additional comparisons are made with a homogenous rural network in Iowa. The results underscore the complexity of ﬂow with topography, urban areas, and land–sea contrasts and demonstrate the inadequacy of existing network strategies.},

	abstract = {The Pleim–Xiu land surface model (PX LSM) has been improved by the addition of a second indirect data assimilation scheme. The ﬁrst, which was described previously, is a technique in which soil moisture is nudged according to the biases in 2-m air temperature and relative humidity between the model- and observationbased analyses. The new technique involves nudging the deep soil temperature in the soil temperature force–restore (FR) model according to model bias in 2-m air temperature only during nighttime. While the FR technique is computationally efﬁcient and very accurate for the special conditions for which it was derived, it is very dependent on the deep soil temperature that drives the restoration term of the surface soil temperature equation. Thus, adjustment of the deep soil temperature to optimize the 2-m air temperature during the night, when surface forcing is minimal, provides signiﬁcant advantages over other methods of deep soil moisture initialization. Simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) using the PX LSM with and without the new deep soil temperature nudging scheme demonstrate substantial beneﬁts of the new scheme for reducing error and bias of the 2-m air temperature. The effects of the new nudging scheme are most pronounced in the winter (January 2006) during which the model’s cold bias is greatly reduced. Air temperature error and bias are also reduced in a summer simulation (August 2006) with the greatest beneﬁts in less vegetated and more arid regions. Thus, the deep temperature nudging scheme complements the soil moisture nudging scheme because it is most effective for conditions in which the soil moisture scheme is least effective, that is, when evapotranspiration is not important (winter and arid climates).},

The results are compared with the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation Model (DALES). Numerical experiments were performed over homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces under clear convective boundary layer conditions. Identical simulations using MM5 and DALES were performed, which enabled an evaluation of the MM5 boundary layer scheme with DALES results. From the experiment with a homogeneous surface, MM5 shows a slightly shallower, colder, and moister boundary layer than DALES. This result is produced by an underestimation of turbulent mixing near the surface and less-vigorous entrainment of heat and dry air in MM5. In the heterogeneous surface experiment, the domain is divided into dry and wet patches, with the result that both models produce a mesoscale circulation. However, relative to the homogeneous case, larger differences were found between the models in the representation of the boundary layer dynamics. In DALES, the surface heterogeneity inﬂuenced the turbulent motions, making the mesoscale circulation much stronger (wmax is 6 times as large) than in MM5. Because of this stronger circulation, the boundary layer height, bulk temperature, and humidity also displayed differences in time and spatial patterns. Because of the land–atmosphere coupling in MM5, the mesoscale circulation strengthened the surface ﬂux heterogeneity. Cold and moist air advection close to the surface from the wet patch to the dry patch increased the sensible heat ﬂux above the dry patch and thus the induced mesoscale ﬂow.},

	abstract = {Geostrophic wind speed data, derived from pressure observations, are used in combination with tower measurements to investigate the nocturnal stable boundary layer at Cabauw, the Netherlands. Since the geostrophic wind speed is not directly inﬂuenced by local nocturnal stability, it may be regarded as an external forcing parameter of the nocturnal stable boundary layer. This is in contrast to local parameters such as in situ wind speed, the Monin–Obukhov stability parameter (z/L), or the local Richardson number. To characterize the stable boundary layer, ensemble averages of clear-sky nights with similar geostrophic wind speeds are formed. In this manner, the mean dynamical behavior of near-surface turbulent characteristics and composite proﬁles of wind and temperature are systematically investigated. The classiﬁcation is found to result in a gradual ordering of the diagnosed variables in terms of the geostrophic wind speed. In an ensemble sense the transition from the weakly stable to very stable boundary layer is more gradual than expected. Interestingly, for very weak geostrophic winds, turbulent activity is found to be negligibly small while the resulting boundary cooling stays ﬁnite. Realistic numerical simulations for those cases should therefore have a comprehensive description of other thermodynamic processes such as soil heat conduction and radiative transfer.},

	abstract = {Dry convective boundary layers characterized by a significant wind shear on the surface and at the inversion are studied by means of the mixed-layer theory. Two different representations of the entrainment zone, each of which has a different closure of the entrainment heat flux, are considered. The simpler of the two is based on a sharp discontinuity at the inversion (zeroth-order jump), whereas the second one prescribes a finite depth of the inversion zone (first-order jump). Large-eddy simulation data are used to provide the initial conditions for the mixed-layer models, and to verify their results. Two different atmospheric boundary layers with different stratification in the free atmosphere are analyzed. It is shown that, despite the simplicity of the zeroth-order-jump model, it provides similar results to the first-order-jump model and can reproduce the evolution of the mixed-layer variables obtained by the large-eddy simulations in sheared convective boundary layers. The mixed-layer model with both closures compares better with the large-eddy simulation results in the atmospheric boundary layer characterized by a moderate wind shear and a weak temperature inversion. These results can be used to represent the flux of momentum, heat, and other scalars at the entrainment zone in general circulation or chemistry transport models.},

Calculations based on a Smagorinsky SGS model are found to be more sensitive to the effective resolution of the simulation than are calculations based on the prognostic turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) SGS model. The difference between calculations based on the two SGS models is attributed to the advective transport, diffusive transport, and/or time-rate-of-change terms in the TKE equation. These terms are found to be leading order in the entrainment zone and allow the SGS TKE to behave in a way that tends to compensate for changes that result in larger or smaller resolved scale entrainment ﬂuxes. This compensating behavior of the SGS TKE model is attributed to the fact that changes that reduce the resolved entrainment ﬂux (viz., values of the eddy viscosity in the upper part of the PBL) simultaneously tend to increase the buoyant production of SGS TKE in the radiatively destabilized portion of the smoke cloud. Increased production of SGS TKE in this region then leads to increased amounts of transported, or fossil, SGS TKE in the entrainment zone itself, which in turn leads to compensating increases in the SGS entrainment ﬂuxes. In the Smagorinsky model, the absence of a direct connection between SGS TKE in the entrainment and radiatively destabilized zones prevents this compensating mechanism from being active, and thus leads to calculations whose entrainment rate sensitivities as a whole reﬂect the sensitivities of the resolvedscale ﬂuxes to values of upper PBL eddy viscosities.},

Analysis of data from the recent Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (HATS) shows that the neglected production terms can be signiﬁcant. Including them in the modeled SFS ﬂux equations yields a more general SFS model, one with a tensor rather than a scalar eddy diffusivity.

New physically based parameterizations are developed for simulating homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation, droplet activation, and the spectral index (width) of the droplet size spectra. Two versions of the scheme are described: one for application in high-resolution cloud models and the other for simulating grid-scale cloudiness in larger-scale models. The versions differ in their treatment of the supersaturation field and droplet nucleation. For the high-resolution approach, droplet nucleation is calculated from Kohler theory applied to a distribution of aerosol that activates at a given supersaturation. The resolved supersaturation field and condensation/deposition rates are predicted using a semianalytic approximation to the three-phase (vapor, ice, liquid) supersaturation equation. For the large-scale version of the scheme, it is assumed that the supersaturation field is not resolved and thus droplet activation is parameterized as a function of the vertical velocity and diabatic cooling rate. The vertical velocity includes a subgrid component that is parameterized in terms of the eddy diffusivity and mixing length. Droplet condensation is calculated using a quasi-steady, saturation adjustment approach. Evaporation/deposition onto the other water species is given by nonsteady vapor diffusion allowing excess vapor density relative to ice saturation.},

	abstract = {This manuscript describes numerical experiments investigating the influence of 2–30-km striplike heterogeneity on wet and dry convective boundary layers coupled to the land surface. The striplike heterogeneity is shown to dramatically alter the structure of the convective boundary layer by inducing significant organized circulations that modify turbulent statistics. The impact, strength, and extent of the organized motions depend critically on the scale of the heterogeneity ␭ relative to the boundary layer height zi. The coupling with the land surface modifies the surface fluxes and hence the circulations resulting in some differences compared to previous studies using fixed surface forcing. Because of the coupling, surface fluxes in the middle of the patches are small compared to the patch edges. At large heterogeneity scales (␭/zi ϳ18) horizontal surface-flux gradients within each patch are strong enough to counter the surface-flux gradients between wet and dry patches allowing the formation of small cells within the patch coexisting with the large-scale patch-induced circulations. The strongest patch-induced motions occur in cases with 4 Ͻ ␭/zi Ͻ 9 because of strong horizontal pressure gradients across the wet and dry patches. Total boundary layer turbulence kinetic energy increases significantly for surface heterogeneity at scales between ␭/zi ϭ 4 and 9; however, entrainment rates for all cases are largely unaffected by the striplike heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the degree of scatter in flux–gradient relationships for stably stratified conditions is analyzed. It is generally found that scatter in the dimensionless lapse rate ␾h is larger than in the dimensionless shear ␾m when plotted versus the stability parameter z/⌳ (where ⌳ is the local Obukhov length). Here, this phenomenon is explained to be a result of self-correlation due to the occurrence of the momentum and the heat flux on both axes, measurement uncertainties, and other possibly relevant physical processes left aside. It is shown that the ratio between relative errors in the turbulent fluxes influences the orientation of self-correlation in the flux–gradient relationships. In stable conditions, the scatter in ␾m is largely suppressed by self-correlation while for ␾h this is not the case (vice versa for unstable stratification). An alternative way of plotting is discussed for determining the slope of the linear ␾m function.},

	abstract = {A parameterization for surface roughness and blending height at regional scales, under neutral atmospheric stability, is studied and tested. The analysis is based on a suite of large-eddy simulations (LES) over surfaces with varying roughness height and multiple variability scales. The LES are based on the scaledependent Lagrangian dynamic subgrid-scale model, and the surface roughnesses at the ground are imposed using the rough-wall logarithmic law. Several patterns of roughness distribution are considered, including random tiling of patches with a wide distribution of length scales. An integral length scale, based on the one-dimensional structure function of the spatially variable roughness height, is used to define the characteristic surface variability scale, which is a critical input in many regional parameterization schemes. Properties of the simulated flow are discussed with special emphasis on the turbulence properties over patches of unequal roughness. The simulations are then used to assess a generalized form of the parameterization for the blending height and the equivalent surface roughness at regional scales that has been developed earlier for regular patterns of surface roughness (regular stripes). The results are also compared with other parameterizations proposed in the literature. Good agreement is found between the simulations and the regional-scale parameterization for the surface roughness and the blending height when this parameterization is combined with the characteristic surface variability scale proposed in this paper.},

The resulting regime is a two-layer flow separated by a change of the temperature gradient at the level of maximum speed. The upper part has turbulence originated by shear production extending up to 3 times the height of wind maximum and of the same order of magnitude as in the layer below. The jet nose is seen by the model as a decoupling layer, and the use of passive scalars allows for the inspection of the amount of transport across it, which is very small. The lower layer is very sensitive to the surface boundary conditions, but the principal patterns in the upper layer do not change significantly.

The total turbulent energy is the sum of the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent potential energy, which is proportional to the potential temperature variance. The closure uses recent observational findings to take into account the mean flow stability. These observations indicate that turbulent transfer of heat and momentum behaves differently under very stable stratification. Whereas the turbulent heat flux tends toward zero beyond a certain stability limit, the turbulent stress stays finite. The suggested scheme avoids the problem of self-correlation. The latter is an improvement over the widely used Monin–Obukhov-based closures. Numerous large-eddy simulations, including a wide range of neutral and stably stratified cases, are used to estimate likely values of two free constants. In a benchmark case the new turbulence closure performs indistinguishably from independent large-eddy simulations.},

In the weakly stable regime, fluxes scale in proportion with variance, while in the very stable regime, stress and scalar fluxes behave differently. At large Ri, the velocity field becomes highly anisotropic and the turbulent potential energy becomes approximately equal to half of the turbulent kinetic energy. It appears that even in the strongly stable regime, beyond what is known as the critical gradient Richardson number, turbulent motions are present.},

The approach is based on the extension of the recently developed method for identiﬁcation of persistent dynamical phases in multidimensional time series, permitting the identiﬁcation of discontinuous temporal changes in underlying model parameters. The ﬁnite element method (FEM) discretization of the resulting variational functional is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting problem and to construct the numerical iterative algorithm. The presented method results in the sparse sequential linear minimization problem with linear constrains. The performance of the framework is demonstrated for the following two application examples: (i) in the context of subgrid-scale parameterization for the Lorenz model with external forcing and (ii) in an analysis of climate impact factors acting on the blocking events in the upper troposphere. The importance of accounting for the nonstationarity issue is demonstrated in the second application example: modeling the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) geopotential time series via a single best stochastic model with time-independent coefﬁcients leads to the conclusion that all of the considered external factors are found to be statistically insigniﬁcant, whereas considering the nonstationary model (which is demonstrated to be more appropriate in the sense of information theory) identiﬁed by the methodology presented in the paper results in identiﬁcation of statistically signiﬁcant external impact factor inﬂuences.},

Individual clouds are tracked over the course of their lifetimes. Precipitation rate decreases progressively as aerosol increases. For larger, precipitating clouds, the polluted clouds have longer lifetimes because of precipitation suppression. For clean aerosol conditions, there is good agreement between the average model precipitation rate and that calculated based on observed radar reﬂectivity Z and precipitation rate R relationships. Precipitation rate can be expressed as a power-law function of liquid water path (LWP) and Nd, to reasonable accuracy. The respective powers for LWP and Nd are of similar magnitude compared to those based on observational studies of stratocumulus clouds. The timeintegrated precipitation rate represented by a power-law function of LWP, Nd, and cloud lifetime is much more reliably predicted than is R expressed in terms of LWP and Nd alone. The precipitation susceptibility (So 5 2dlnR/dlnNd) that quantiﬁes the sensitivity of precipitation to changes in Nd depends strongly on LWP and exhibits nonmonotonic behavior with a maximum at intermediate LWP values. The relationship between So and precipitation efﬁciency is explored and the importance of including dependence on Nd in the latter is highlighted. The results provide trade cumulus cloud population statistics, as well as relationships between microphysical/macrophysical properties and precipitation, that are amenable for use in larger-scale models.},

Maximum frequency of occurrence of the LLJ is found in the southern Great Plains. Theories proposed to explain the diurnal wind maximum of the Great Plains LLJ include inertial oscillation of the ageostrophic wind, the diurnal oscillation of the horizontal pressure ﬁeld associated with heating and cooling of the sloping terrain, and the western boundary current interpretations. A simple equation system and output from the 12-km horizontal resolution Weather Research and Forecasting Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NAM) for July 2008 are used to provide evidence as to the importance of the Great Plains topography in driving the LLJ. Summertime heating of the sloping terrain is critical in establishing the climatological position for the Great Plains LLJ. Heating enhances the background geostrophic ﬂow associated with the Bermuda high, resulting in a maximum low-level mean summertime ﬂow over the Great Plains region. Maximum geostrophic winds in the NAM are found during late afternoon, providing a large background wind on which frictional decoupling can act. The nighttime LLJ maximum is the result of an inertial oscillation of the unbalanced components that arise fundamentally from frictional decoupling. Diurnal heating of the sloping terrain forces a cycle in the geostrophic wind that is out of phase with the wind maximum.},

Simulations are performed of a continuously turbulent SBL with surface heterogeneity added in the form of streamwise transitions in surface temperature. Temperature differences between patches of 6 and 3 K are explored with patch length scales ranging from one-half to twice the equivalent homogeneous boundary layer height. The surface temperature heterogeneity has important effects on the mean wind speed and potential temperature proﬁles as well as on the surface heat ﬂux distribution. Increasing the difference between the patch temperatures results in decreased magnitude of the average surface heat ﬂux, with a corresponding increase in the mean potential temperature in the boundary layer. The simulation results are also used to test existing models for average surface ﬂuxes over heterogeneous terrain. The tested models fail to fully represent the average turbulent heat ﬂux, with models that break the domain into homogeneous subareas grossly underestimating the heat ﬂux magnitude over patches with relatively colder surface temperatures. Motivated by these results, a new parameterization based on local similarity theory is proposed. The new formulation is found to correct the bias over the cold patches, resulting in improved average surface heat ﬂux calculations.},

By using this perspective, continuous time-dependent wind proﬁles are predicted. As such, information on both the height and the magnitude of the nocturnal low-level jet is available as a function of time.

It is found that a more humid environment immediately above the boundary layer is present before the start of late afternoon heavy precipitation events. The higher moisture content is brought by wind from the south. Greater boundary layer inhomogeneity in moist static energy, temperature, moisture, and horizontal wind before precipitation begins is correlated to larger rain rates at the initial stage of precipitation. In an examination of afternoon rain statistics, higher relative humidity above the boundary layer is correlated to an earlier onset and longer duration of afternoon precipitation events, whereas greater boundary layer inhomogeneity and atmospheric instability in the 2–4-km layer above the surface are positively correlated to the total rain amount and the maximum rain rate. Although other interpretations may be possible, these observations are consistent with theories for the transition from shallow to deep convection that emphasize the role of a moist lower free troposphere and boundary layer inhomogeneity.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to determine the mechanism that modulates the initiation of convection within convergence zones caused by land surface–induced mesoscale ﬂows. An idealized modeling approach linked quantitatively to observations of vegetation breezes over tropical Benin was used. A large-eddy model was used with a prescribed land surface describing heterogeneities between crop and forest over which vegetation breezes have been observed. The total surface ﬂuxes were constant but the Bowen ratio varied with vegetation type. The heterogeneous land surface created temperature differences consistent with observations, which in turn forced mesoscale winds and convection at the convergence zones over the crop boundaries. At these convergence zones optimum conditions for the initiation of convection were found in the afternoon; the equivalent potential temperature was higher in the convergence zones than over anywhere else in the domain, due to reduced entrainment, and the mesoscale convergence produced a persistent increase in vertical wind velocities of up to 0.5 m s21 over a 5–10-km region. The relative importance of these two mechanisms depended on the synoptic conditions. When convective inhibition was weak, the thermodynamic conditions at the convergence zone were most important, as the triggering of convection was easily accomplished. However, when the thermodynamic proﬁle inhibited convection, the mesoscale updrafts became essential for triggering in order to break through the inhibiting barrier. At the same time, subsidence over the forest produced a warm capping layer over the boundary layer top that suppressed convection over the forest throughout the afternoon.},

	abstract = {An investigation of nocturnal intermittent turbulence during the Cooperative Atmosphere–Surface Exchange Study in 1999 (CASES-99) revealed three turbulence regimes at each observation height: 1) regime 1, a weak turbulence regime when the wind speed is less than a threshold value; 2) regime 2, a strong turbulence regime when the wind speed exceeds the threshold value; and 3) regime 3, a moderate turbulence regime when top-down turbulence sporadically bursts into the otherwise weak turbulence regime. For regime 1, the strength of small turbulence eddies is correlated with local shear and weakly related to local stratiﬁcation. For regime 2, the turbulence strength increases systematically with wind speed as a result of turbulence generation by the bulk shear, which scales with the observation height. The threshold wind speed marks the transition above which the boundary layer approaches near-neutral conditions, where the turbulent mixing substantially reduces the stratiﬁcation and temperature ﬂuctuations. The preference of the turbulence regimes during CASES-99 is closely related to the existence and the strength of low-level jets. Because of the different roles of the bulk and local shear with regard to turbulence generation under different wind conditions, the relationship between turbulence strength and the local gradient Richardson number varies for the different turbulence regimes. Turbulence intermittency at any observation height was categorized in three ways: turbulence magnitude oscillations between regimes 1 and 2 as wind speed varies back and forth across its threshold value, episodic turbulence enhancements within regime 1 as a result of local instability, and downbursts of turbulence in regime 3.},

	abstract = {The collapse of turbulence in the nocturnal boundary layer is studied by means of a simple bulk model that describes the basic physical interactions in the surface energy balance. It is shown that for a given mechanical forcing, the amount of turbulent heat that can be transported downward is limited to a certain maximum. In the case of weak winds and clear skies, this maximum can be signiﬁcantly smaller than the net radiative loss minus soil heat transport. In the case when the surface has low heat capacity, this imbalance generates rapid surface cooling that further suppresses the turbulent heat transport, so that eventually turbulence largely ceases (positive feedback mechanism). The model predicts the minimum wind speed for sustainable turbulence for the so-called crossing level. At this level, some decameters above the surface, the wind is relatively stationary compared to lower and higher levels. The critical speed is predicted in the range of about 5–7 m s21, depending on radiative forcing and surface properties, and is in agreement with observations at Cabauw. The critical value appears not very sensitive to model details or to the exact values of the input parameters. Finally, results are interpreted in terms of external forcings, such as geostrophic wind. As it is generally larger than the speed at crossing height, a 5 m s21 geostrophic wind may be considered as the typical limit below which sustainable, continuous turbulence under clear-sky conditions is unlikely to exist. Below this threshold emergence of the very stable nocturnal boundary layer is anticipated.},

	abstract = {The mechanism behind the collapse of turbulence in the evening as a precursor to the onset of the very stable boundary layer is investigated. To this end a cooled, pressure-driven ﬂow is investigated by means of a local similarity model. Simulations reveal a temporary collapse of turbulence whenever the surface heat extraction, expressed in its nondimensional form h/L, exceeds a critical value. As any temporary reduction of turbulent friction is followed by ﬂow acceleration, the long-term state is unconditionally turbulent. In contrast, the temporary cessation of turbulence, which may actually last for several hours in the nocturnal boundary layer, can be understood from the fact that the time scale for boundary layer diffusion is much smaller than the time scale for ﬂow acceleration. This limits the available momentum that can be used for downward heat transport. In case the surface heat extraction exceeds the so-called maximum sustainable heat ﬂux (MSHF), the near-surface inversion rapidly increases. Finally, turbulent activity is largely suppressed by the intense density stratiﬁcation that supports the emergence of a different, calmer boundary layer regime.},

	abstract = {This study seeks to quantitatively and qualitatively understand how stability affects transport in the continuously turbulent stably stratiﬁed atmospheric boundary layer, based on a suite of large-eddy simulations. The test cases are based on the one adopted by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS) project, but with a largely expanded stability range where the gradient Richardson number (Rig) reaches up to around 1. The analysis is mainly focused on understanding the modiﬁcation of turbulent structures and dynamics with increasing stability in order to improve the modeling of the stable atmospheric boundary layer in weather and climate models, a topic addressed in Part II of this work. It is found that at quasi equilibrium, an increase in stability results in stronger vertical gradients of the mean temperature, a lowered low-level jet, a decrease in vertical momentum transport, an increase in vertical buoyancy ﬂux, and a shallower boundary layer. Analysis of coherent turbulent structures using two-point autocorrelation reveals that the autocorrelation of the streamwise velocity is horizontally anisotropic while the autocorrelation of the vertical velocity is relatively isotropic in the horizontal plane and its integral length scale decreases as stability increases. The effects of stability on the overall turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and its budget terms are also investigated, and it is shown that the authors’ large-eddy simulation results are in good agreement with previous experimental ﬁndings across varied stabilities. Finally, Nieuwstadt’s local-scaling theory is reexamined and it is concluded that the height z is not a relevant scaling parameter and should be replaced by a constant length scale away from the surface, indicating that the z-less range starts lower than previously assumed.},

Based on a suite of large-eddy simulations in Part I where the effects of stability on the turbulent structures and kinetic energy are investigated, ﬁrst-order parameterization schemes are assessed and tested in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)’s single-column model. The applicability of the gradient-ﬂux hypothesis is ﬁrst examined and it is found that stable conditions are favorable for that hypothesis. However, the concept of introducing a stability correction function fm as a multiplicative factor into the mixing length used under neutral conditions lN is shown to be problematic because fm computed a priori from large-eddy simulations tends not to be a universal function of stability. With this observation, a novel mixing-length model is proposed, which conforms to large-eddy simulation results much better under stable conditions and converges to the classic model under neutral conditions. Test cases imposing steady as well as unsteady forcings are developed to evaluate the performance of the new model. It is found that the new model exhibits robust performance as the stability strength is changed, while other models are sensitive to changes in stability. For cases with unsteady forcings, which are very rarely simulated or tested, the results of the singlecolumn model and large-eddy simulations are also closer when the new model is used, compared to the other models. However, unsteady cases are much more challenging for the turbulence closure formulations than cases with steady surface forcing.},

By formulating a correction for the modeled shear stress, using experimental ﬁndings of a logarithmic region in the streamwise turbulent ﬂuctuations, the need for a ﬁlter is eliminated. This allows one to model the wall shear stress locally, and at the same time accurately recover the correct average value.

It is shown that the proposed model performs equally well or better than the previous ﬁltered models.

The extended model retains the anisotropic form of the original stretched-vortex model, but the SGS kinetic energy and the characteristic SGS eddy size are modiﬁed by buoyancy subject to two constraints: ﬁrst, the SGS kinetic energy dynamics is determined by stationary and homogeneous conditions, and second, the SGS eddy size obeys a scaling analogous to the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. The SGS model construction, comprising an ensemble of subgrid stretched-vortical structures, naturally limits vertical mixing but allows horizontal mixing provided the alignment of the SGS vortex ensemble is favorable, even at high nominal gradient Richardson numbers. In very stable stratiﬁcation, the model recovers the z-less limit, in which a vortex-based Obukhov length controls the SGS dynamics, while in very unstable stratiﬁcation, the model recovers the free-convection limit, in which a vortex-based Deardorff velocity controls the SGS dynamics. The efﬁcacy of the present SGS model is demonstrated by simulating the canonical stationary and homogeneous, stratiﬁed sheared turbulence at high Reynolds numbers and moderately high Richardson numbers. In the postprocessing, the SGS dynamics of the stretched-vortex model is further interrogated to yield predictions of buoyancy-adjusted one-dimensional SGS spectra and SGS root-mean-square velocity-derivative ﬂuctuations.},

	abstract = {The entrainment zone (EZ) of a dry, shear-free convective boundary layer growing into a linearly stratiﬁed ﬂuid is studied by means of direct numerical simulation. The scale separation between the boundary layer thickness and the Kolmogorov length scale is shown to be sufﬁcient to observe Reynolds number similarity in the statistics of interest during the equilibrium entrainment regime. Contrary to previous considerations, the vertical structure of the entrainment zone is found to be better described by the superposition of two sublayers: 1) an upper EZ sublayer that is dominated by overshooting thermals and is characterized by a penetration depth that scales with the ratio of the convective velocity and the buoyancy frequency of the free troposphere and 2) a lower EZ sublayer that is dominated by troughs of mixed ﬂuid and is characterized by the integral length scale of the mixed layer. Correspondingly, different buoyancy scales are identiﬁed. The consequences of this multiplicity of scales on the entrainment rate parameters are evaluated directly, without resorting to any bulk model, through an exact relation among the mean entrainment rate, the local buoyancy increment, and both the turbulent and the ﬁnite-thickness contributions to the entrainment ratio A measured at the height of minimum buoyancy ﬂux. The smaller turbulent contribution to A that is usually observed for relatively thick EZs is found to be compensated by the smaller local buoyancy increment instead of by the ﬁnite-thickness contribution. The two-layer structure of the entrainment zone is found to affect the exponent of the power-law relation between the normalized mean entrainment rate and the convective Richardson number such that the exponent deviates from 21 for typical atmospheric conditions, although it asymptotically approaches 21 for higher Richardson numbers.},

An identical LES setup, including advection discretization and SGS model parameters, is used for all cases, which is a stringent test on the ability of LES to accurately capture diverse conditions without any ﬂow-adjustable parameters. The LES predictions agree well with observations and previously reported model results. A grid-resolution convergence study is carried out, and for all cases the mean proﬁles exhibit good grid-resolution independence, even for resolutions that are typically considered coarse. Second-order statistics, for example, variances, converge at ﬁner resolutions compared to domain means. The simulations show that 90\% of the turbulent kinetic energy (at each level) must be resolved to obtain sufﬁciently converged mean proﬁles. This empirical convergence criterion can be used as a guide in designing future LES runs.},

	abstract = {The stratocumulus-top mixing process is investigated using direct numerical simulations of a shear-free cloud-top mixing layer driven by evaporative and radiative cooling. An extension of previous linear formulations allows for quantifying radiative cooling, evaporative cooling, and the diffusive effects that artiﬁcially enhance mixing and evaporative cooling in high-viscosity direct numerical simulations (DNS) and many atmospheric simulations. The diffusive cooling accounts for 20\% of the total evaporative cooling for the highest resolution (grid spacing ;14 cm), but this can be much larger (;100\%) for lower resolutions that are commonly used in large-eddy simulations (grid spacing ;5 m). This result implies that the k scaling for cloud cover might be strongly inﬂuenced by diffusive effects. Furthermore, the deﬁnition of the inversion point as the point of neutral buoyancy hbi(zi) 5 0 allows the derivation of two scaling laws. The in-cloud scaling law relates the velocity and buoyancy integral scales to a buoyancy ﬂux deﬁned by the inversion point. The entrainment-zone scaling law provides a relationship between the entrainment velocity and the liquid evaporation rate. By using this inversion point, it is shown that the radiative-cooling contribution to the entrainment velocity decouples from the evaporative-cooling contribution and behaves very similarly as in the smoke cloud. Finally, evaporative and radiative cooling have similar strengths, when this strength is measured by the integrated buoyancy source. This result partially explains why current entrainment parameterizations are not accurate enough, given that most of them implicitly assume that only one of the two mechanisms rules the entrainment.},

	abstract = {The authors describe the Lagrangian cloud simulator (LCS), which simulates droplet growth in air turbulence. The LCS adopts the Euler–Lagrangian framework and can provide reference data for cloud microphysical models by tracking the growth of particles individually. The collisional growth in a stagnant ﬂow is calculated by the LCS and also by solving the stochastic collision–coalescence equation (SCE). Good agreement is obtained between the LCS and SCE simulations. Comparisons between the results for stagnant and turbulent ﬂows conﬁrm that in-cloud turbulence enhances collisional growth. The enhancement is well predicted by the SCE method if a proper collision model is employed. To quantify the enhancement, the paper deﬁnes the time scale of the autoconversion process, in which cloud droplets grow into raindrops through collisions, as the time taken for 10\% of the cloud to become rain (t10\%). The authors then deﬁne the turbulence enhancement factor Eturb as Eturb 5 t10\%[NoT]/t10\%[T], where the overbar denotes the mean value of the LCS runs and the subscripts NoT and T indicate stagnant (nonturbulent) ﬂow and turbulent ﬂow simulations, respectively. It was found that the enhancement factor increases linearly with the energy dissipation rate, while it does not show a consistent dependence on the Reynolds number. The levels of statistical ﬂuctuations in the autoconversion time scales were directly obtained for the ﬁrst time. It is shown that the relative standard deviation of t10\% simply follows the power law that the binomial distribution theory predicts, independently of the ﬂow conditions.},

	abstract = {Field observations and theoretical analysis are used to investigate the appearance of different nocturnal boundary layer regimes. Recent theoretical ﬁndings predict the appearance of two different regimes: the continuously turbulent (weakly stable) boundary layer and the relatively ‘‘quiet’’ (very stable) boundary layer. A large number of nights (approximately 4500 in total) are analyzed using an ensemble averaging technique. The observations support the existence of these two fundamentally different regimes: weakly stable (turbulent) nights rapidly reach a steady state (within 2–3 h). In contrast, very stable nights reach a steady state much later after a transition period (2–6 h). During this period turbulence is weak and nonstationary. To characterize the regime, a new parameter is introduced: the shear capacity. This parameter compares the actual shear after sunset with the minimum shear needed to sustain continuous turbulence. In turn, the minimum shear is dictated by the heat ﬂux demand at the surface (net radiative cooling), so that the shear capacity combines ﬂow information with knowledge of the boundary condition. It is shown that the shear capacity enables prediction of the ﬂow regimes. The prognostic strength of this nondimensional parameter appears to outperform the traditional ones like the similarity parameter z/L and the gradient Richardson number Ri as a regime indicator.},

When the thermal stratiﬁcation becomes strong, the presence of such motions could affect the turbulent mixing to a large extent, and common similarity theory that is used to describe weakly stable conditions may become unreliable. The authors apply a statistical clustering methodology based on a bounded variation, ﬁnite-element method (FEM-BV) to characterize the interaction between small-scale nonturbulent motions and turbulence. The clustering methodology achieves a multiscale representation of nonstationary turbulence data by approximating them through an optimal sequence of locally stationary multivariate autoregressive factor model (VARX) processes and some slow hidden process switching between them. The clustering method is used to separate periods with different inﬂuence of the nonturbulent motions on the vertical velocity ﬂuctuations. The methodology can be used in a later stage to derive a stochastic parameterization for the interactions between nonturbulent and turbulent motions.},

	abstract = {In this study, shear-based parameterizations of turbulent mixing in the stable atmospheric boundary layer (SABL) are proposed. A relevant length-scale estimate for the mixing length LM of the turbulent momentum ﬁeld is constructed from the turbulent kinetic energy Ek and the mean shear rate S as LEkS [ Ek1/2/S. Using observational data from two ﬁeld campaigns—the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment and the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere–Surface Exchange Study (CASES-99)—LEkS is shown to have a strong correlation with LM. The relationship between LM and LEkS corresponds to the ratio of the magnitude of the tangential components of the turbulent momentum ﬂux tensor t to Ek, known as stress intensity ratio, c2 5 t/Ek. The ﬁeld data clearly show that c2 is linked to stability. The stress intensity ratio also depends on the ﬂow energetics that can be assessed using a shear-production Reynolds number, ReSP 5 P/(nS2), where P is shear production of turbulent kinetic energy and n is the kinematic viscosity. This analysis shows that high mixing rates can indeed persist at strong stability. On this basis, shear-based parameterizations are proposed for the eddy diffusivity for momentum, KM, and eddy diffusivity for heat, KH, showing remarkable agreement with the exact quantities. Furthermore, a broader assessment of the proposed parameterizations is given through an a priori evaluation of large-eddy simulation (LES) data from the ﬁrst GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS). The shear-based parameterizations outperform many existing models in predicting turbulent mixing in the SABL. The results of this study provide a framework for improved representation of the SABL in operational models.},

	abstract = {A theory is presented for the Great Plains low-level jet in which the jet emerges in the sloping atmospheric boundary layer as the nocturnal phase of an oscillation arising from diurnal variations in turbulent diffusivity (Blackadar mechanism) and surface buoyancy (Holton mechanism). The governing equations are the equations of motion, mass conservation, and thermal energy for a stably stratiﬁed ﬂuid in the Boussinesq approximation. Attention is restricted to remote (far above slope) geostrophic winds that blow along the terrain isoheights (southerly for the Great Plains). Diurnally periodic solutions are obtained analytically with diffusivities that vary as piecewise constant functions of time and slope buoyancies that vary as piecewise linear functions of time. The solution is controlled by 11 parameters: slope angle, Coriolis parameter, freeatmosphere Brunt–Väisälä frequency, free-atmosphere geostrophic wind, radiative damping parameter, day and night diffusivities, maximum and minimum surface buoyancies, and times of maximum surface buoyancy and sunset. The Holton mechanism, by itself, results in relatively weak wind maxima but produces strong jets when paired with the Blackadar mechanism. Jets with both Blackadar and Holton mechanisms operating are shown to be broadly consistent with observations and climatological analyses. Jets strengthen with increasing geostrophic wind, maximum surface buoyancy, and day-to-night ratio of the diffusivities and weaken with increasing Brunt–Väisälä frequency and magnitude of minimum slope buoyancy (greater nighttime cooling). Peak winds are maximized for slope angles characteristic of the Great Plains.},

Continuous weakly stratiﬁed turbulence is maintained for this range of cooling, and the SBL splits into two regions depending on the location of the lowlevel jet (LLJ) and Cr. Above the LLJ, turbulence is very weak and the gradient Richardson number is nearly constant: Ri ; 0:25. Below the LLJ, small scales are dynamically important as the shear and buoyancy frequencies vary with mesh resolution. The heights of the SBL and Ri noticeably decrease as the mesh is varied from 2003 to 10243. Vertical proﬁles of the Ozmidov scale Lo show its rapid decrease with increasing Cr, with Lo , 2 m over a large fraction of the SBL for high cooling. Flow visualization identiﬁes ubiquitous warm–cool temperature fronts populating the SBL. The fronts span a large vertical extent, tilt forward more so as the surface cooling increases, and propagate coherently. In a height–time reference frame, an instantaneous vertical proﬁle of temperature appears intermittent, exhibiting a staircase pattern with increasing distance from the surface. Observations from CASES-99 also display these features. Conditional sampling based on linear stochastic estimation is used to identify coherent structures. Vortical structures are found upstream and downstream of a temperature front, similar to those in neutrally stratiﬁed boundary layers, and their dynamics are central to the front formation.},

The simulations focus on the meter and submeter scales that are expected to be relevant for entrainment, and the ﬁnest grid spacing is Dx 5 26 cm. The entrainment velocity is investigated from the analysis of the integrated-buoyancy evolution equation, which is exactly derived from the ﬂow evolution equations. The analysis shows that sedimentation interacts with entrainment through two different mechanisms. As previously reported, sedimentation prevents droplets from evaporating in the entrainment zone, which in turn reduces the entrainment velocity. Here it is shown that sedimentation also promotes a positive buoyancy ﬂux that directly opposes entrainment. The strengths of both mechanisms are characterized by two different settling numbers, which allow for predicting which meteorological conditions favor the reduction of entrainment by sedimentation. These new insights allow for including sedimentation in a parameterization of the entrainment velocity. The reduction of the entrainment velocity by sedimentation predicted by the parameterization and observed in the simulations is 3 times larger than previously reported in large-eddy simulations, which implies that meter- and submeterscale turbulence plays an important role in the interaction of entrainment with sedimentation. On the whole, analysis and simulations indicate that stratocumulus entrainment is more sensitive to the cloud droplet number density due to sedimentation than previously thought.},

Such LLJs develop in a tilted atmospheric boundary layer as a result of inertia–gravity oscillations initiated by a change of the surface thermal forcing during the evening transition. External parameters are the free-atmospheric geostrophic wind, ambient atmospheric stratiﬁcation, surface buoyancy forcing, and slope angle. The governing momentum and buoyancy balance equations are written in slope-following coordinates, and solved numerically in the Boussinesq approximation. The surface forcing is prescribed in a form of surface buoyancy or buoyancy ﬂux, both of which are slope-uniform but change in time. LLJs over slopes are contrasted with LLJs over ﬂat terrain.},

	abstract = {The characteristics of wind proﬁles in a neutral atmospheric boundary layer and their dependence on the geostrophic wind speed Ug, Coriolis parameter f, and surface roughness length z0 are examined utilizing largeeddy simulations. These simulations produce a constant momentum ﬂux layer and a log-law layer above the surface characterized by a logarithmic increase of wind speed with height. The von Kármán constant derived from the mean wind proﬁle is around 0.4 over a wide range of control parameters. The depths of the simulated boundary layer, constant-ﬂux layer, and surface log-law layer tend to increase with the wind speed and decrease with an increasing Coriolis parameter. Immediately above the surface log-law layer, a second log-law layer has been identiﬁed from these simulations. The depth of this upper log-law layer is comparable to its counterpart in the surface layer, and the wind speed can be scaled as u*(u*/fh)3/4, as opposed to just u* in the surface log-law layer, implying that in addition to surface processes, the upper log-law layer is also inﬂuenced by Earth’s rotation and large-scale conditions. Here u* is the friction velocity at the surface, and h is the boundary layer depth. An analytical model is proposed to assist in the interpretation of the log laws in a typical Ekman boundary layer. The physics and implications of the upper log-law layer are discussed.},

	abstract = {According to Townsend’s hypothesis, so-called wall-attached eddies are the main contributors to turbulent transport in the atmospheric surface layer (ASL). This is also one of the main assumptions of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST). However, previous evidence seems to indicate that outerscale eddies can impact the ASL, resulting in deviations from the classic MOST scaling. We conduct largeeddy simulations and direct numerical simulations of a dry convective boundary layer to investigate the impact of coherent structures on the ASL. A height-dependent passive tracer enables coherent structure detection and conditional analysis based on updrafts and subsidence. The MOST similarity functions computed from the simulation results indicate a larger deviation of the momentum similarity function fm from classical scaling relationships compared to the temperature similarity function fh. The conditionalaveraged fm for updrafts and subsidence are similar, indicating strong interactions between the inner and outer layers. However, fh conditioned on subsidence follows the mixed-layer scaling, while its updraft counterpart is well predicted by MOST. Updrafts are the dominant contributors to the transport of momentum and temperature. Subsidence, which comprises eddies that originate from the outer layer, contributes increasingly to the transport of temperature with increasing instability. However, u0 of different signs are distributed symmetrically in subsidence unlike the predominantly negative u0 as instability increases. Thus, the spatial patterns of u0w0 differ compared to u0w0 in regions of subsidence. These results depict the mechanisms for departure from the MOST scaling, which is related to the stronger role of subsidence.},

	abstract = {Direct numerical simulations resolving meter and submeter scales in the cloud-top region of stratocumulus are used to investigate the interactions between a mean vertical wind shear and in-cloud turbulence driven by evaporative and radiative cooling. There are three major results. First, a critical velocity jump (Du)crit exists, above which shear signiﬁcantly broadens the entrainment interfacial layer (EIL), enhances cloud-top cooling, and increases the mean entrainment velocity; shear effects are negligible when the velocity jump is below (Du)crit. Second, a depletion velocity jump (Du)dep exists, above which shear-enhanced mixing reduces cloud-top radiative cooling, thereby weakening the large convective motions; shear effects remain localized within the EIL when the velocity jump is below (Du)dep. The critical velocity jump and depletion velocity jump are provided as a function of in-cloud and free-tropospheric conditions, and one ﬁnds (Du)crit ’ 124 m s21 and (Du)dep ’ 3210 m s21 for typical subtropical conditions. Third, the individual contributions to the mean entrainment velocity from mixing, radiative cooling, and evaporative cooling strongly depend on the choice of the reference height where the entrainment velocity is calculated. This result implies that the individual contributions to the mean entrainment velocity should be estimated at a comparable height while deriving entrainment-rate parameterizations. A strong shear alters substantially the magnitude and the height where these individual contributions reach their maxima, which further demonstrates the importance of shear on the dynamics of stratocumulus clouds.},

	abstract = {We perform direct numerical simulation of the Couette ﬂow as a model for the stable boundary layer. The ﬂow evolution is investigated for combinations of the (bulk) Reynolds number and the imposed surface buoyancy ﬂux. First, we establish what the similarities and differences are between applying a ﬁxed buoyancy difference (Dirichlet) and a ﬁxed buoyancy ﬂux (Neumann) as boundary conditions. Moreover, two distinct parameters were recently proposed for the turbulent-to-laminar transition: the Reynolds number based on the Obukhov length and the ‘‘shear capacity,’’ a velocity-scale ratio based on the buoyancy ﬂux maximum. We study how these parameters relate to each other and to the atmospheric boundary layer. The results show that in a weakly stratiﬁed equilibrium state, the ﬂow statistics are virtually the same between the different types of boundary conditions. However, at stronger stratiﬁcation and, more generally, in nonequilibrium conditions, the ﬂow statistics do depend on the type of boundary condition imposed. In the case of Neumann boundary conditions, a clear sensitivity to the initial stratiﬁcation strength is observed because of the existence of multiple equilibriums, while for Dirichlet boundary conditions, only one statistically steady turbulent equilibrium exists for a particular set of boundary conditions. As in previous studies, we ﬁnd that when the imposed surface ﬂux is larger than the maximum buoyancy ﬂux, no turbulent steady state occurs. Analytical investigation and simulation data indicate that this maximum buoyancy ﬂux converges for increasing Reynolds numbers, which suggests a possible extrapolation to the atmospheric case.},

	abstract = {We present a conceptual model for the diurnal cycle of the dry atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). It may serve as a framework for future numerical studies on the transitional dynamics that characterize the ABL over land. The conceptual model enables us to deﬁne expressions for relevant physical scales as a function of the most prominent forcing parameters and the low degree of complexity facilitates a dimensionless description. This is useful to help generalize boundary layer dynamics that occur on a diurnal time scale. Further, the model’s application for numerical studies is illustrated herein with two examples: a single-column-model study that assesses the effect of wind forcing on the main characteristics of the diurnal cycle, and a large-eddy-simulation study on the daily evolution of turbulence under weak-wind-forcing conditions. The results from these studies sketch the general evolution of the present set of diurnal-cycle systems in more detail. We discuss how the setups are able to reproduce well-known dynamical features of the ABL and also highlight limitations, where the simple conceptual system is unable to describe realistic ABL behavior. We conclude that the present conceptual model has an interesting balance between model-system complexity and physical realism, such that it is useful for future idealized studies on the diurnal cycle of the ABL.},

	abstract = {Cloud-top entrainment is a crucial process for the evolution of stratocumulus and is driven by interactions of radiation, microphysics, and turbulence on scales reaching down to less than one meter. Regardless of this fact, most large-eddy simulation studies still apply a horizontal resolution of tens of meters, not resolving these interactions sufﬁciently. Here, based on an extensive observational campaign, we deﬁne a weak-shear benchmark scenario for large-eddy simulation over Arctic ice and for the ﬁrst time perform large-eddy simulation of mixed-phase stratocumulus with horizontal resolutions of 35, 10, and 3.5 m. Thereby, we investigate the processes contributing to cloud-top entrainment and their role for the evolution of stratocumulus with a particular focus on resolution sensitivity. First, we ﬁnd that a horizontal grid spacing larger than 10 m insufﬁciently represents the effects of small-scale microphysical cooling and turbulent engulfment on cloud-top entrainment. Indeed, the small size of energycontaining eddies—a consequence of the intense stratiﬁcation in the vicinity of the cloud-top region—violates the underlying assumptions of subgridscale models by buoyant suppression of eddies at the large-eddy simulation ﬁlter scale. Second, the decrease in cloud-top entrainment due to these insufﬁciently represented processes results in 15\% less cloud water after 6 h of simulation and a corresponding optical thinning of the cloud. Third, we show that the applied nonequilibrium microphysics cause microphysical heating beneath the cloud top, which partly counteracts the evaporative cooling.},

The number of iterations to solve for stability has been shortened from 20 to 3, and adjustments have been made to the basic proﬁle stability functions. The scalar transfer coefﬁcients have been redeﬁned in terms of the mixing ratio, which is the fundamentally conserved quantity, rather than the measured water vapor mass concentration. Both the velocity and scalar roughness lengths have been changed. For the velocity roughness, the original ﬁxed value of the Charnock parameter has been replaced by one that increases with wind speeds of between 10 and 18 m s Ϫ1. The scalar roughness length parameterization has been simpliﬁed to ﬁt both an early set of NOAA/Environmental Technology Laboratory (ETL) experiments and the Humidity Exchange Over the Sea (HEXOS) program. These changes slightly increase the ﬂuxes for wind speeds exceeding 10 m sϪ1. For interested users, two simple parameterizations of the surface gravity wave inﬂuence on ﬂuxes have been added (but not evaluated).},

In all cases, favorable comparisons are obtained between G-K-S theory, eigenvalue determination, and numerical simulation. The conventional definition of stability is then sharpened to include only those spatial discretizations that are asymptotically stable (bounded, Left Half-Plane eigenvalues). It is shown that many of the higher-order schemes which are G-K-S stable are not asymptotically stable. A series of compact fourth- and sixth-order schemes, which are both asymptotically and G-K-S stable for the scalar case, are then developed.},

Boundary and near boundary schemes of the same order as the interior are also developed using polynomial interpolation and for a general compact scheme on a non-uniform grid it is shown that polynomial interpolation is more eﬃcient than the conventional method of undetermined coeﬃcients for ﬁnding coeﬃcients of the scheme. The high-order non-uniform schemes along with boundary closure of up to 14th order thus obtained are shown to be stable on a non-uniform grid with appropriate stretching so that more grid points are clustered near the boundary. The stability and resolution properties of the high-order non-uniform grid schemes are studied and the results of three numerical tests on stability and accuracy properties are also presented.},

This method preserves the extended stability property of the RKC method for solving ODEs, and it requires only one projection per step. An additional projection on the time derivative of the velocity is performed whenever a second-order approximation for the pressure is desired. We demonstrate both by numerical experiments and by order analysis that the method is second order accurate in time for both the velocity and the pressure. Being explicit, the RKC projection method is easy to implement and to parallelize. Hence it is an attractive candidate for the solution of large-scale, moderately stiﬀ, diﬀusion-like problems.},

It can accommodate a wide range of pressure gradients, and general time-dependent boundary conditions such as incoming wakes or wall forcing. The consistency orders of the advective and pressure-correction steps are different, but it is shown that the overall resolution is controlled by the higher-order advection step. The formulation of boundary conditions to ensure global mass conservation in the presence of arbitrary forcing is carefully analyzed. Two validation boundary layers with and without a strong adverse pressure gradient are presented, with maximum Reynolds numbers Reh \% 2000. They agree well with the available experiments. Turbulent inﬂow conditions for the zero-pressure case are implemented by a recycling method, and it is shown that at least the initial 300 momentum thicknesses have to be discarded before the effect of the artiﬁcial inﬂow is forgotten. It is argued that this is not a defect of the method used to generate the inﬂow, but a property of the boundary layer.},

	abstract = {Flows in which shock waves and turbulence are present and interact dynamically occur in a wide range of applications, including inertial conﬁnement fusion, supernovae explosion, and scramjet propulsion. Accurate simulations of such problems are challenging because of the contradictory requirements of numerical methods used to simulate turbulence, which must minimize any numerical dissipation that would otherwise overwhelm the small scales, and shock-capturing schemes, which introduce numerical dissipation to stabilize the solution. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the performance of several numerical methods capable of simultaneously handling turbulence and shock waves. A comprehensive range of high-resolution methods (WENO, hybrid WENO/central difference, artiﬁcial diffusivity, adaptive characteristic-based ﬁlter, and shock ﬁtting) and suite of test cases (Taylor–Green vortex, Shu–Osher problem, shock-vorticity/entropy wave interaction, Noh problem, compressible isotropic turbulence) relevant to problems with shocks and turbulence are considered. The results indicate that the WENO methods provide sharp shock proﬁles, but overwhelm the physical dissipation. The hybrid method is minimally dissipative and leads to sharp shocks and well-resolved broadband turbulence, but relies on an appropriate shock sensor. Artiﬁcial diffusivity methods in which the artiﬁcial bulk viscosity is based on the magnitude of the strain-rate tensor resolve vortical structures well but damp dilatational modes in compressible turbulence; dilatation-based artiﬁcial bulk viscosity methods signiﬁcantly improve this behavior. For well-deﬁned shocks, the shock ﬁtting approach yields good results. Ó 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In turbulent flow past rigid boundaries, there can be distinguished regions close to the wall in which the local rates of energy production and dissipation are so large that aspects of the turbulent motion concerned with these processes are determined almost solely by the distribution of shear stress within the region and are independent of conditions outside it. These regions are here called equilibrium layers because of the equilibrium existing between local rates of energy production and dissipation. Three kinds of equilibrium layer have been studied experimentally, the constant-stress layer, the transpiration layer and the zero-stress layer, but there are other possible forms. One that is of importance in the theory of self-preserving flow in boundary layers and in diffusers is the ‘linear-stress’ layer in which the stress increases linearly with distance from the wall. The properties of these various equilibrium layers are considered and the distributions of mean velocity are derived from the equation for the turbulent kinetic energy and certain assumptions of flow similarity.
            The theory of self-preserving wall flow, usually expressed as a combination of the law of the wall and the defect law, assumes compatibility between the outer flow and the equilibrium layer, and the course of development depends on the kind of equilibrium layer. Earlier work by the author, which assumed the defect law, is only valid if the whole of the equilibrium layer is a constant-stress layer and this is not true in strong adverse pressure gradients. A consistent theory is developed for these flows by assuming a ‘linear-stress’ layer, and the solutions show the relation between flows of finite stress and of zero stress and provide a plausible explanation of the phenomenon of downstream instability observed by Clauser. Self-preserving flow in wedges is treated on similar lines.},

An experiment in the shear layer of a circular jet has shown that the usual definitions, based on peaks of the space-time correlations of the fluctuations, yield convection velocities whose magnitudes depend on the value of space or time separation chosen. An alternative approach shows that, by considering the turbulent field as a superposition of harmonic travelling waves, a wave-number/velocity spectrum can be defined that lends itself to the definition of a wave-number-dependent convection velocity and an overall convection velocity, both of which have real physical significance. An experimental technique is described for obtaining the spectrum, and results are presented for one position in the shear layer of the jet.},

	abstract = {A theory is derived for the class of long two-dimensional waves, comprising solitary and periodic cnoidal waves, that can propagate with unchanging form in heterogeneous fluids. The treatment is generalized to the extent that the waves are supposed to arise on a horizontal stream of incompressible fluid whose density and velocity are arbitrary functions of height, and the upper surface of the fluid is allowed either to be free or to be fixed in a horizontal plane. Explicit formulae for the wave properties and a general interpretation of the physical conditions for the occurrence of the waves are achieved without need to specify particular physical models; but in a later part of the paper, §4, the results are applied to three examples that have been worked out by other means and so provide checks on the present theory. These general results are also shown to accord nicely with the principle of ‘conjugate-flow pairs’ which was explained by Benjamin (1962
              b
              ) with reference to swirling flows along cylindrical ducts, but which is known to apply equally well to flow systems of the kind in question here.
            
            The theory reveals certain physical peculiarities of a type of flow model often used in theoretical studies of internal-wave phenomena, being specified so as to make the equation for the stream-function linear. In an appendix, some observations are also made regarding the ‘Boussinesq approximation’, which too is often used as a simplifying assumption in this field. It is shown, adding to a recent discussion by Long (1965), that finite internal waves may depend crucially on small effects neglected in this approximation.},

	abstract = {A considerable quantity of observations and measurements exists concerning the phenomenon of intermittency which is connected closely with the entrainment process in free turbulent flows. A number of these are described in the first part of the paper and conclusions are drawn about the shape and motion of the bounding surface that separates turbulent and non-turbulent fluid. The salient features are that indentations of the surface grow and decay cyclically, that each cycle leads to substantial entrainment of ambient fluid into the turbulent region, that the indentations move at a considerable speed relative to the free stream, and that the surface has a comparatively simple form. The growth–decay cycle of the indentations suggests that a critical condition for growth exists, but the pressure field consequent on the convection velocity of the indentations makes for a Helmholtz type of instability that is unlikely to be stabilized by purely viscous behaviour of the turbulent fluid. It is known that the initial response of turbulent fluid to distortion is elastic in character, with incremental Reynolds stress proportional to increment of total strain, and sufficient rigidity could stabilize the bounding surface. A simple flow model–an inviscid stream flowing over an elastic jelly—is examined and the condition for marginal stability is compared with the observed properties of the flow. The model leads to the conclusion that indentations of more than a critical wave-number are stable, and provides reasons for the comparatively simple form of the surface and for the occurrence of indentations in groups of about three. The relative values of entrainment constants in different flows of uniform density do not depend critically on the nature of the entrainment process provided that the main turbulent motion remains geometrically similar, but the correlation between entrainment constant and relative depth of the indentations found by Gartshore (1966) appears as a consequence of the ‘elastic’ control of the growth–decay cycle. Lastly, the properties of the engulfment mechanism are used to show that the entrainment constant for a jet is proportional to the square root of the ratio of ambient density to the average density inside the jet. In contrast, the corresponding result for engulfment controlled by an eddy viscosity is variation as the ratio of the mean of the ambient and inside density to the inside density. Observations of high-speed jets of water in air and air in water give some support to the ‘elastic’ hypothesis.},

	abstract = {The exact time-dependent three-dimensional Navier-Stokes and temperature equations are integrated numerically to simulate stably stratified homogeneous turbulent shear flows at moderate Reynolds numbers whose horizontal mean velocity and mean temperature have uniform vertical gradients. The method uses shear-periodic boundary conditions and a combination of finite-difference and pseudospectral approximations. The gradient Richardson number
              Ri
              is varied between 0 and 1. The simulations start from isotropic Gaussian fields for velocity and temperature both having the same variances.
            
            
              The simulations represent approximately the conditions of the experiment by Komori
              et al.
              (1983) who studied stably stratified flows in a water channel (molecular Prandtl number
              Pr
              = 5). In these flows internal gravity waves build up, superposed by hot cells leading to a persistent counter-gradient heat-flux (CGHF) in the vertical direction, i.e. heat is transported from lower-temperature to higher-temperature regions. Further, simulations with
              Pr
              = 0.7 for air have been carried out in order to investigate the influence of the molecular Prandtl number. In these cases, no persistent CGHF occurred. This confirms our general conclusion that the counter-gradient heat flux develops for strongly stable flows (
              Ri
              ≈ 0.5–1.0) at sufficiently large Prandtl numbers (
              Pr
              = 5). The flux is carried by hot ascending, as well as cold descending turbulent cells which form at places where the highest positive and negative temperature fluctuations initially existed. Buoyancy forces suppress vertical motions so that the cells degenerate to two-dimensional fossil turbulence. The counter-gradient heat flux acts to enforce a quasi-static equilibrium between potential and kinetic energy.
            
            
              Previously derived turbulence closure models for the pressure-strain and pressure-temperature gradients in the equations for the Reynolds stress and turbulent heat flux are tested for moderate-Reynolds-number flows with strongly stable stratification (
              Ri
              = 1). These models overestimate the turbulent interactions and underestimate the buoyancy contributions. The dissipative timescale ratio for stably stratified turbulence is a strong function of the Richardson number and is inversely proportional to the molecular Prandtl number of the fluid.},

It is found that, for all orientations of the mean scalar gradient, the sum of the pressure-scalar gradient and velocity gradient-scalar gradient terms in the turbulent scalar flux balance equation are approximately aligned with the scalar flux vector itself. In addition, the time derivative of the scalar flux is also approximately aligned with the flux vector for the developed fields (corresponding to roughly constant correlation coefficients). These alignments lead directly to a gradient transport model with a tensor turbulent diffusivity. The simulation results are used to fit a dimensionless model coefficient as a function of the turbulence Reynolds and Péclet numbers. The model is tested against two different passive-scalar fields in fully developed turbulent channel flow (also generated by direct numerical simulation) and is found to predict the scalar flux quite well throughout the entire channel.},

            Here in Part 2 the comparisons with experimental data are presented in detail. The whole set of classic Nikuradze (1932) data, concerning both velocity distribution and skin friction, was chosen for comparison. The instructive coincidence of predictions with experimental data suggests the conclusion that the influence of molecular viscosity within the main body of fully developed turbulent shear flows remains essential, even at very large Reynolds numbers. Meanwhile, some incompleteness of the experimental data presented in the work of Nikuradze (1932) is noticed, namely the lack of data in the range of parameters where the difference between scaling law and universal logarithmic law predictions should be the largest.},

	abstract = {The statistical features of turbulence can be studied either through spectral quantities, 
such as the kinetic energy spectrum, or through structure functions, which are statistical 
moments of the difference between velocities at two points separated by a variable 
distance. In this paper structure function relations for two-dimensional turbulence 
are derived and compared with calculations based on wind data from 5754 airplane 
flights, reported in the MOZAIC data set. For the third-order structure function 
two relations are derived, showing that this function is generally positive in the two-dimensional case, contrary to the three-dimensional case. In the energy inertial range 
the third-order structure function grows linearly with separation distance and in the 
enstrophy inertial range it grows cubically with separation distance. A Fourier analysis 
shows that the linear growth is a reflection of a constant negative spectral energy flux, 
and the cubic growth is a reflection of a constant positive spectral enstrophy flux. 
Various relations between second-order structure functions and spectral quantities 
are also derived. The measured second-order structure functions can be divided into 
two different types of terms, one of the form
              r
              2/3
              , giving a
              k

giving a
              k
              −3
              -range in the energy spectrum. The 
structure functions agree better with the two-dimensional isotropic relation for larger 
separations than for smaller separations. The flatness factor is found to grow very fast 
for separations of the order of some kilometres. The third-order structure function 
is accurately measured in the interval [30, 300] km and is found to be positive. The 
average enstrophy flux is measured as
              Π

argued that the

              −3

	abstract = {Boundary-forced stratified turbulence is studied in the prototypical case of turbulent 
channel flow subject to stable stratification. The large-eddy simulation approach is 
used with a mixed subgrid model that involves a dynamic eddy viscosity component 
and a scale-similarity component. After an initial transient, the flow reaches a new 
balanced state corresponding to active wall-bounded turbulence with reduced vertical 
transport which, for the cases in our study with moderate-to-large levels of stratification, 
coexists with internal wave activity in the core of the channel. A systematic 
reduction of turbulence levels, density fluctuations and associated vertical transport 
with increasing stratification is observed. Countergradient buoyancy flux is observed 
in the outer region for sufficiently high stratification.
            Mixing of the density field in stratified channel flow results from turbulent events 
generated near the boundaries that couple with the outer, more stable flow. The 
vertical density structure is thus of interest for analogous boundary-forced mixing 
situations in geophysical flows. It is found that, with increasing stratification, the 
mean density profile becomes sharper in the central region between the two turbulent 
layers at the upper and lower walls, similar to observations in field measurements as 
well as laboratory experiments with analogous density-mixing situations.
            
              Channel flow is strongly inhomogeneous with alternative choices for the Richardson 
number. In spite of these complications, the gradient Richardson number,

              O
              (1) value across most of the channel. It 
is remarkable that stratified channel flow, with such a large variation of overall 
density difference (factor of 26) between cases, shows a relatively universal behaviour 
of correlation coefficients and vertical Froude number when plotted as a function of

              (1998) are used to study the structure of the 
flow in the intermittent zone where there are, alternately, regions of fully turbulent 
flow and non-turbulent velocity fluctuations on either side of a thin randomly moving 
interface. Comparisons are made with a wake that is ‘forced’ by amplifying initial 
velocity fluctuations. A temperature field
              T
              , with constant values of 1.0 and 0 above 
and below the wake, is transported across the wake as a passive scalar. The value of

            Statistics for the conditional vorticity and velocity variances, available in such detail 
only from DNS data, show how streamwise and spanwise components of vorticity are 
generated by vortex stretching in the bulges of the interface. While mean Reynolds 
stresses (in the fixed reference frame) decrease gradually in the intermittent zone, 
conditional stresses are roughly constant and then decrease sharply towards zero 
at the interface. Flow fields around the interface, analysed in terms of the local 
streamline pattern, confirm and explain previous results that the advancement of the 
vortical interface into the irrotational flow is driven by large-scale eddy motion.
            Terms used in one-point turbulence models are evaluated both conventionally and 
conditionally in the interface region, and the current practice in statistical models of 
approximating entrainment by a diffusion process is assessed.},

For the isotropic case it is essentially an eddy-viscosity assumption in real space for the Kármán-Howarth equation.

              2
              , approximately the same expression for the eddy-viscosity function is determined from experimental data. The resulting closed equation for the double-correlation function is solved numerically for both large and moderate Reynolds numbers, and the results are compared with experimental data. Self-similar solutions of the basic equation predict turbulent energy decay inversely proportional to time. It is shown that the departure from this ‘initial-period decay law’ observed in laboratory data is due to the behaviour of grid-produced correlation functions for large separation distances.},

It is assumed that phase changes across the flow are negligible and hence that the aerodynamic pressure on the wave is in phase with its displacement (rather than its slope). A variational formulation is established and leads to the determination of appropriately weighted means for the velocity profiles. The principal application is to flow of a light inviscid fluid over a viscous liquid; it is shown that the principle of exchange of stabilities is applicable to such a configuration, and a critical wind speed in satisfactory agreement with observation is predicted for an air-oil interface. The results also are applied to an air-water interface and lead to the conclusion that Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of such an interface is unlikely at commonly observed wind speeds. A more general formulation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz boundary-value problem and variational principle, allowing for variations in both velocity and density, is given in two appendices.},

The average flow field conditioned to the attached clusters reveals similar conical structures of low streamwise velocity for the rough- and smooth-walled cases, which eventually grow into the global modes previously identified from spectral analysis. We conclude that the vortex clusters of the turbulent outer region either originate away from the wall, or quickly forget their origin, in agreement with Townsend's similarity hypothesis.},

              τ
              ≤2000. Comparisons are made with experimental data at higher Reynolds numbers. It is found, in agreement with previous investigations, that the intensity profiles of the streamwise and spanwise velocity components have logarithmic ranges that are traced to the widening spectral range of scales as the wall is approached. The same is true for the pressure, both theoretically and observationally, but not for the normal velocity or for the tangential stress cospectrum, although even those two quantities have structures with lengths of the order of several hundred times the wall distance. Because the logarithmic range grows longer as the Reynolds number increases, variables which are ‘attached’ in this sense scale in the buffer layer in mixed units. These results give strong support to the attached-eddy scenario proposed by Townsend (1976), but they are not linked to any particular eddy model. The scaling of the outer modes is also examined. The intensity of the streamwise velocity at fixed
              y
              /
              h
              increases with the Reynolds number. This is traced to the large-scale modes, and to an increased intensity of the ejections but not of the sweeps. Several differences are found between the outer structures of different flows. The outer modes of the spanwise and wall-normal velocities in boundary layers are stronger than in internal flows, and their streamwise velocities penetrate closer to the wall. As a consequence, their logarithmic layers are thinner, and some of their logarithmic slopes are different. The channel statistics are available electronically at

	abstract = {The passive scalar field of a temporally evolving shear layer is investigated using gradient trajectories as a means to analyse the scalar probability density function and the conditional scalar dissipation rate in the presence of external intermittency. These results are of significance for turbulent combustion, where improved predictions of the statistics of the conditional dissipation rate are needed in several models. First, the variation of the conventional first and second moments of the conditional dissipation rate across the layer is quantitatively documented in detail. A strong dependence of the conditional dissipation rate on the lateral position and on the conditioning value of the scalar is observed. The dependence on the transverse distance to the centre-plane partially explains the double-hump profile usually reported when this dependence is ignored. The variation with the scalar observed in the ratio between the second and first moments would invalidate certain assumptions commonly done in turbulent combustion. It is also seen that conditioning on the scalar does not reduce the fluctuation of the dissipation rate with respect to unconditional values. Next, the role of external intermittency in these results is investigated. For that purpose, the flow is partitioned into different zones based on different types of gradient trajectories passing through each point, thereby introducing non-local information in comparison with the standard turbulent/non-turbulent separation based on the conventional intermittency function. In addition to the homogeneous outer regions, three zones are identified: a turbulent zone, a turbulence interface and quasi-laminar diffusion layers. The relative contribution from each of these zones to the conventional intermittency factor is reported. The statistics are then conditioned on each of these zones, and the spatial variation of the scalar distribution and of the conditional scalar dissipation rate is explained in terms of the observed zonal statistics. For the Reynolds numbers of the present simulation, between 1500 and 3000 based on the vorticity thickness and the velocity difference, and a Schmidt number equal to 1, it results that the major contribution to both statistics is due to the turbulence interfaces. At the same time, the turbulent zone shows a distinct behaviour, being approximately homogeneous but anisotropic.},

              between 60 and 100 nozzle diameters from the nozzle in order to investigate the dynamics and transport processes at the continuous and well-defined bounding interface between the turbulent and non-turbulent regions of flow. The jet carries a fluorescent dye measured with planar
              laser-induced fluorescence
              (LIF), and the surface discontinuity in the scalar concentration is identified as the fluctuating turbulent jet interface. Thence the mean outward ‘boundary entrainment’ velocity is derived and shown to be a constant fraction (about 0.07) of the the mean jet velocity on the centreline. Profiles of the conditional mean velocity, mean scalar and momentum flux show that at the interface there are clear discontinuities in the mean axial velocity and mean scalar and a tendency towards a singularity in mean vorticity. These actual or asymptotic discontinuities are consistent with the conditional mean momentum and scalar transport equations integrated across the interface. Measurements of the fluxes of turbulent kinetic energy and enstrophy are consistent with computations by Mathew \& Basu (
              Phys. Fluids
              , vol. 14, 2002, pp. 2065–2072) in showing that for a jet flow (without forcing) the entrainment process is dominated by small-scale eddying at the highly sheared interface (‘nibbling’), with large-scale engulfing making a small (less than 10\%) contribution consistent with concentration measurements showing that the interior of the jet is well mixed. (Turbulent jets differ greatly from the free shear layer in this respect.) To explain the difference between velocity and scalar profiles, their conditional mean gradients are defined in terms of a local eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity and the momentum and scalar fluxes inside the interface. Since the eddy diffusivity is larger than the eddy viscosity, the scalar profile is flatter inside the interface so that the scalar discontinuity is relatively greater than the mean velocity discontinuity. Theoretical arguments, following Hunt, Eames \& Westerweel (in
              Proc. of the IUTAM Symp. on Computational Physics and New Perspectives in Turbulence
              , ed. Y. Kaneda, vol. 4, 2008, pp. 331–338, Springer), are proposed for how the vortex sheet develops, how the internal structure of the interface layer relates to the inhomogeneous rotational and irrotational motions on each side and why the dominant entrainment process of jets and wakes differs from that of free shear layers.},

	abstract = {A field experiment – the Snow Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (SnoHATS) – has been performed over an extensive glacier in Switzerland in order to study small-scale turbulence in the stable atmospheric surface layer, and to investigate the role, dynamics and modelling of the subgrid scales (SGSs) in the context of large-eddy simulations. The
              a priori
              data analysis aims at comparing the role and behaviour of the SGSs under stable conditions with previous studies under neutral or unstable conditions. It is found that the SGSs in a stable surface layer remain an important sink of temperature variance and turbulent kinetic energy from the resolved scales and carry a significant portion of the fluxes when the filter scale is larger than the distance to the wall. The fraction of SGS fluxes (out of the total fluxes) is found to be independent of stability. In addition, the stress–strain alignment is similar to the alignment under neutral and unstable conditions. The model coefficients vary considerably with stability but in a manner consistent with previous findings, which also showed that scale-dependent dynamic models can capture this variation. Furthermore, the variation of the coefficients for both momentum and heat SGS fluxes can be shown to be better explained by stability parameters based on vertical gradients, rather than vertical fluxes. These findings suggest that small-scale turbulence dynamics and SGS modelling under stable conditions share many important properties with neutral and convective conditions, and that a unified approach is thus possible. This paper concludes with a discussion of some other challenges for stable boundary-layer simulations that are not encountered in the neutral or unstable cases.},

The emphasis is on the qualitative differences between turbulent, intermediate and non-turbulent flow regions, emanating from the solenoidal nature of the turbulent region, the irrotational character of the non-turbulent region and the mixed nature of the intermediate region in between. The results are obtained from a particle tracking experiment and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a temporally developing flow without mean shear. The analysis reveals that turbulence influences its neighbouring ambient flow in three different ways depending on the distance to the TNTI: (i) pressure has the longest range of influence into the ambient region and in the far region non-local effects dominate.

The fourth spatial coordinate is introduced formally to be homogeneous and mathematically orthogonal to the others, similar to the spanwise coordinate. Exponential growth of small 4D perturbations superimposed onto 3D turbulent solutions was observed in the Reynolds number range from Re = 4000 to Re = 10 000. The growth rate of small 4D perturbations expressed in wall units was found to be λ+4D = 0.016 independent of Reynolds number. Nonlinear evolution of 4D perturbations leads either to attenuation of turbulence and relaminarization or to establishment of a self-sustained 4D turbulent solution (4D turbulent ﬂow). Both results on ﬂow evolution were obtained at the lowest Reynolds number, depending on the grid resolution, pointing to the proximity of Re = 4000 as the critical Reynolds number for 4D turbulence. Self-sustained 4D turbulence appeared to be less intense compared with 3D turbulence in terms of mean wall friction, which is about 55 \% of that predicted by the empirical Dean law for turbulent channel ﬂow at all Reynolds numbers considered. Thus, the law of resistance of 4D turbulent channel ﬂow can be expressed as Cf = 0.04Re−0.25.},

In most cases, a regime of large-scale oblique laminar-turbulent patterns is identiﬁed at the onset of transition, as in the case of pure shear ﬂows. The current study indicates that this oblique regime can be shifted up to large values of the Reynolds number Re by increasing the damping by the Coriolis, buoyancy or Lorentz force. We show evidence for this phenomenon in three distinct ﬂow cases: plane Couette ﬂow with spanwise cyclonic rotation, plane magnetohydrodynamic channel ﬂow with a spanwise or wall-normal magnetic ﬁeld, and open channel ﬂow under stable stratiﬁcation. Nearwall turbulence structures inside the turbulent patterns are invariably found to scale in terms of viscous wall units as in the fully turbulent case, while the patterns themselves remain large-scale with a trend towards shorter wavelength for increasing Re. Two distinct regimes are identiﬁed: at low Reynolds numbers the patterns extend from one wall to the other, while at large Reynolds number they are conﬁned to the near-wall regions and the patterns on both channel sides are uncorrelated, the core of the ﬂow being highly turbulent without any dominant large-scale structure.},

	abstract = {Using direct numerical simulation, we investigate stationary and homogeneous sheardriven turbulence in various stratiﬁcations, ranging from neutral to very stable. To attain and maintain a stationary ﬂow, we throttle the mean shear so that the net production stays constant for all times. This results in a ﬂow that is characterized solely by its mean shear and its mean buoyancy gradient, independent of initial conditions. The method of throttling is validated by comparison with experimental spectra in the case of neutral stratiﬁcation. With increasing stratiﬁcation comes the emergence of vertically sheared large-scale horizontal motions that preclude a straightforward interpretation of ﬂow statistics. However, once these motions are excluded, simply by subtracting the horizontal average, the underlying ﬂow appears amenable to the standard methods of turbulence analysis. It is shown that a direct acknowledgement of the conﬁning inﬂuence of the periodic simulation box can lead to a meaningful physical interpretation of the large scales. Once an appropriate conﬁnement scale is identiﬁed, many features, including horizontal spectra, ﬂux–gradient relationships and length scales, of stratiﬁed sheared turbulence can be readily understood, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in terms of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. Finally, the similarity-theory framework is used to interpret the scaling of the vertical diapycnal diffusivity in stratiﬁed turbulence.},

	abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of free convection over a smooth, heated plate are used to investigate unbounded, unsteady turbulent convection. Four different boundary conditions are considered: free-slip or no-slip walls, and constant buoyancy or constant buoyancy ﬂux. It is ﬁrst shown that, after the initial transient, the vertical structure agrees with observations in the atmospheric boundary layer and predictions from classical similarity theory. A quasi-steady inner layer and a self-preserving outer layer are clearly distinguished, with an overlap region between them of constant turbulent buoyancy ﬂux. The extension of the overlap region reached in our simulations is more than 100 wall units (κ3/Bs)1/4, where Bs is the surface buoyancy ﬂux and κ the corresponding molecular diffusivity (the Prandtl number is one). The buoyancy ﬂuctuation inside the overlap region already exhibits the −1/3 power-law scaling with height for the four types of boundary conditions, as expected in the local, freeconvection regime. However, the mean buoyancy gradient and the vertical velocity ﬂuctuation are still evolving toward the corresponding power laws predicted by the similarity theory. The second major result is that the relation between the Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers agrees with that reported in Rayleigh–Be´nard convection when the heated plate is interpreted as half a convection cell. The range of Rayleigh numbers covered in the simulations is then 5 × 107–109. Further analogies between the two problems indicate that knowledge can be transferred between steady Rayleigh–Be´nard and unsteady convection. Last, we ﬁnd that the inner scaling based on \{Bs, κ\} reduces the effect of the boundary conditions to, mainly, the diffusive wall layer, the ﬁrst 10 wall units. There, near the plate, free-slip conditions allow stronger mixing than no-slip ones, which results in 30 \% less buoyancy difference between the surface and the overlap region and 30–40 \% thinner diffusive sublayers. However, this local effect also entails one global, substantial effect: with an imposed buoyancy, free-slip systems develop a surface ﬂux 60 \% higher than that obtained with no-slip walls, which implies more intense turbulent ﬂuctuations across the whole boundary layer and a faster growth.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Direct numerical simulations of stably stratified Ekman layers are conducted to study the effect of increasing static stability on turbulence dynamics and modelling in wall-bounded flows at three moderate Reynolds numbers. The flow field is analysed by examining the mean profiles of wind speed, potential temperature and momentum flux, as well as streamwise velocity and temperature spectra. The maximum stabilizing buoyancy flux that a flow can sustain while remaining fully turbulent is found to depend on the Reynolds number. The flows with the highest Reynolds number display a relatively well-developed inertial range and logarithmic layer, and are found to bear similarities to much higher-Reynolds-number flows like the ones encountered in the atmospheric boundary layer. In particular, the near-wall mean profiles follow the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. However, several flow features, such as the critical Richardson number and the stress–strain alignment, are found to maintain significant dependence on the Reynolds number. The budgets of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), vertical velocity variance, momentum and buoyancy fluxes, and temperature variance are analysed. The results indicate that the effect of stability on turbulence is first directly manifested in the vertical velocity variance budget, and results in damping of vertical motions. This then leads to a reduction in the downward transport of horizontal momentum components towards the surface, and consequently to a decrease in the shear production term in the TKE budget: changes in the vertical profile of TKE shear production with increasing Richardson number are significant and have a larger impact on TKE than direct buoyancy destruction. The reduction in vertical velocity variance also results in significant drops in the production terms in the momentum flux, buoyancy flux and temperature variance budgets. Various assumptions and parameters related to low-order turbulence closures are investigated. The results suggest that the vertical velocity variance is a more appropriate parameter than the full TKE on which to base eddy-diffusivity and viscosity models.},

	abstract = {The logarithmic law for the mean velocity in turbulent boundary layers has long provided a valuable and robust reference for comparison with theories, models and large-eddy simulations (LES) of wall-bounded turbulence. More recently, analysis of high-Reynolds-number experimental boundary-layer data has shown that also the variance and higher-order moments of the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuations u + display logarithmic laws. Such experimental observations motivate the question whether LES can accurately reproduce the variance and the higher-order moments, in particular their logarithmic dependency on distance to the wall. In this study we perform LES of very high-Reynolds-number wall-modelled channel ﬂow and focus on proﬁles of variance and higher-order moments of the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuations. In agreement with the experimental data, we observe an approximately logarithmic law for the variance in the LES, with a ‘Townsend–Perry’ constant of A1 ≈ 1.25. The LES also yields approximate logarithmic laws for the higher-order moments of the streamwise velocity. Good agreement is found between Ap, the generalized ‘Townsend–Perry’ constants for moments of order 2p, from experiments and simulations. Both are indicative of sub-Gaussian behaviour of the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuations. The near-wall behaviour of the variance, the ranges of validity of the logarithmic law and in particular possible dependencies on characteristic length scales such as the roughness length z0, the LES grid scale ∆, and subgrid scale mixing length Cs∆ are examined. We also present LES results on moments of spanwise and wall-normal ﬂuctuations of velocity.},

	abstract = {Existence of non-turbulent ﬂow patches in the vicinity of the wall of a turbulent ﬂow is known as global intermittency. Global intermittency challenges the conventional statistics approach when describing turbulence in the inner layer and calls for the use of conditional statistics. We extend the vorticity-based conditioning of a ﬂow to turbulent and non-turbulent sub-volumes by a high-pass ﬁlter operation. This modiﬁed method consistently detects non-turbulent ﬂow patches in the outer and inner layers for stratiﬁcations ranging from the neutral limit to extreme stability, where the ﬂow is close to a complete laminarization. When applying this conditioning method to direct numerical simulation data of stably stratiﬁed Ekman ﬂow, we ﬁnd the following. First, external intermittency has a strong effect on the logarithmic law for the mean velocity in Ekman ﬂow under neutral stratiﬁcation. If instead of the full ﬁeld, only turbulent sub-volumes are considered, the data ﬁt an idealized logarithmic velocity proﬁle much better; in particular, a problematic dip in the von Kármán measure κ in the surface layer is decreased by approximately 50 \% and our data only support the reduced range 0.41 κ 0.43. Second, order-one changes in turbulent quantities under strong stratiﬁcation can be explained by a modulation of the turbulent volume fraction rather than by a structural change of individual turbulence events; within the turbulent fraction of the ﬂow, the character of individual turbulence events measured in terms of turbulence dissipation rate or variance of velocity ﬂuctuations is similar to that under neutral stratiﬁcation.},

A new decomposition is postulated that ensures non-turbulent regions in the ﬂow do not contaminate the ﬂuctuating velocity components in the turbulent regions.

	abstract = {Finite-amplitude manifestations of stratified shear flow instabilities and their spatio-temporal coherent structures are believed to play an important role in turbulent geophysical flows. Such shear flows commonly have layers separated by sharp density interfaces, and are therefore susceptible to the so-called Holmboe instability, and its finite-amplitude manifestation, the Holmboe wave. In this paper, we describe and elucidate the origin of an apparently previously unreported long-lived coherent structure in a sustained stratified shear flow generated in the laboratory by exchange flow through an inclined square duct connecting two reservoirs filled with fluids of different densities. Using a novel measurement technique allowing for time-resolved, near-instantaneous measurements of the three-component velocity and density fields simultaneously over a three-dimensional volume, we describe the three-dimensional geometry and spatio-temporal dynamics of this structure. We identify it as a finite-amplitude, nonlinear, asymmetric confined Holmboe wave (CHW), and highlight the importance of its spanwise (lateral) confinement by the duct boundaries. We pay particular attention to the spanwise vorticity, which exhibits a travelling, near-periodic structure of sheared, distorted, prolate spheroids with a wide ‘body’ and a narrower ‘head’. Using temporal linear stability analysis on the two-dimensional streamwise-averaged experimental flow, we solve for three-dimensional perturbations having two-dimensional, cross-sectionally confined eigenfunctions and a streamwise normal mode. We show that the dispersion relation and the three-dimensional spatial structure of the fastest-growing confined Holmboe instability are in good agreement with those of the observed confined Holmboe wave. We also compare those results with a classical linear analysis of two-dimensional perturbations (i.e. with no spanwise dependence) on a one-dimensional base flow. We conclude that the lateral confinement is an important ingredient of the confined Holmboe instability, which gives rise to the CHW, with implications for many inherently confined geophysical flows such as in valleys, estuaries, straits or deep ocean trenches. Our results suggest that the CHW is an example of an experimentally observed, inherently nonlinear, robust, long-lived coherent structure which has developed from a linear instability. We conjecture that the CHW is a promising candidate for a class of exact coherent states underpinning the dynamics of more disordered, yet continually forced stratified shear flows.},

However, the increasing complexity of hydrological models means that a large number of parameters need to be estimated. To better understand how these complex models work, efﬁcient SA methods should be applied before the application of hydrological modeling. This study provides a comprehensive review of global SA methods in the ﬁeld of hydrological modeling. The common deﬁnitions of SA and the typical categories of SA methods are described. A wide variety of global SA methods have been introduced to provide a more efﬁcient evaluation framework for hydrological modeling. We review, analyze, and categorize research into global SA methods and their applications, with an emphasis on the research accomplished in the hydrological modeling ﬁeld. The advantages and disadvantages are also discussed and summarized. An application framework and the typical practical steps involved in SA for hydrological modeling are outlined. Further discussions cover several important and often overlooked topics, including the relationship between parameter identiﬁcation, uncertainty analysis, and optimization in hydrological modeling, how to deal with correlated parameters, and time-varying SA. Finally, some conclusions and guidance recommendations on SA in hydrological modeling are provided, as well as a list of important future research directions that may facilitate more robust analyses when assessing hydrological modeling performance.},

Speciﬁc attention is given to the use of data-driven methods to detect patterns in spatial and temporal data that do not make assumptions about underlying statistical properties of patterns. These methods include e.g. decomposition methods, binning based methods, unsupervised classiﬁcation and temporal stability analysis. We then analyze the value of considering patterns in evaluating model performance, reducing uncertainty in prediction of states and ﬂuxes, as well as for upscaling and downscaling.

	abstract = {A method to analyze the daily cycle of evapotranspiration over land is presented. It quantiﬁes the inﬂuence of external forcings, such as radiation and advection, and of internal feedbacks induced by boundary layer, surface layer, and land surface processes on evapotranspiration. It consists of a budget equation for evapotranspiration that is derived by combining a time derivative of the Penman–Monteith equation with a mixed-layer model for the convective boundary layer. Measurements and model results for days at two contrasting locations are analyzed using the method: midlatitudes (Cabauw, Netherlands) and semiarid (Niamey, Niger). The analysis shows that the time evolution of evapotranspiration is a complex interplay of forcings and feedbacks. Although evapotranspiration is initiated by radiation, it is signiﬁcantly regulated by the atmospheric boundary layer and the land surface throughout the day. In both cases boundary layer feedbacks enhance the evapotranspiration up to 20 W m22 h21. However, in the case of Niamey this is offset by the land surface feedbacks since the soil drying reaches 230 W m22 h21. Remarkably, surface layer feedbacks are of negligible importance in a fully coupled system. Analysis of the boundary layer feedbacks hints at the existence of two regimes in this feedback depending on atmospheric temperature, with a gradual transition region in between the two. In the low-temperature regime speciﬁc humidity variations induced by evapotranspiration and dry-air entrainment have a strong impact on the evapotranspiration. In the high-temperature regime the impact of humidity variations is less pronounced and the effects of boundary layer feedbacks are mostly determined by temperature variations.},

	abstract = {The onset of moist convection over land is investigated using a conceptual approach with a slab boundary layer model. The authors determine the essential factors for the onset of boundary layer clouds over land and study their relative importance. They are 1) the ratio of the temperature to the moisture lapse rates of the free troposphere, that is, the inversion Bowen ratio; 2) the mean daily surface temperature; 3) the relative humidity of the free troposphere; and 4) the surface evaporative fraction. A clear transition is observed between two regimes of moistening of the boundary layer as assessed by the relative humidity at the boundary layer top. In the ﬁrst so-called wet soil advantage regime, the moistening results from the increase of the mixedlayer speciﬁc humidity, which linearly depends on the surface evaporative fraction and inversion Bowen ratio through a dynamic boundary layer factor. In the second so-called dry soil advantage regime, the relative humidity tendency at the boundary layer top is controlled by the thermodynamics and changes in the moist adiabatic induced by the decreased temperature at the boundary layer top and consequent reduction in saturation water vapor pressure. This regime pertains to very deep boundary layers under weakly stratiﬁed free troposphere over hot surface conditions. In the context of the conceptual model, a rise in freetropospheric temperature (global warming) increases the occurrence of deep convection and reduces the cloud cover over moist surfaces. This study provides new intuition and predictive capacity on the mechanism controlling the occurrence of moist convection over land.},

	abstract = {The tiling method is used in many land surface models to represent the surface heterogeneity. Each grid box is divided into fractions of different types of land use with independent solutions of the surface energy budget. An area-weighted average of the energy ﬂuxes is computed to couple with the atmosphere, assuming the air above the surface is well blended at a given height. In the framework of validation of the tiling method, the ECMWF land surface scheme has been tested in ofﬂine mode driven by meteorological forcing provided by the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). Two contrasting surfaces in the boreal region of southern Finland are considered: a Scots pine forest (Hyyti€al€a) and a small nearby lake (Valkea-Kotinen). The ﬁeld observations are used to evaluate the land surface model simulations for both energy ﬂuxes and reservoirs. The model is able to characterize the main difference between the two sites, which appears in the energy partitioning, explained by the lake’s large thermal inertia. In fact, while a large portion of the incoming solar radiation in the forest is released as sensible heat, the lake stores a substantial amount of energy in the water during late spring and summer and releases it in autumn. The different behavior of the ﬂuxes both on annual and diurnal time scales conﬁrms the beneﬁt of a tiling mechanism in the presence of large contrast. However, it is also shown that the assumption of similar conditions at the blending height introduces errors.},

	abstract = {Distributed hydrological models simulate states and ﬂuxes of water and energy in the terrestrial hydrosphere at each cell. The predicted spatial patterns result from complex nonlinear relationships and feedbacks. Spatial patterns are often neglected during the modeling process, and therefore a spatial sensitivity analysis framework that highlights their importance is proposed. This study features a comprehensive analysis of spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration (ET) and land surface temperature (LST), with the aim of quantifying the extent to which forcing data and model parameters drive these patterns. This framework is applied on a distributed model [MIKE Système Hydrologique Européen (MIKE SHE)] coupled to a land surface model [Shuttleworth and Wallace–Evapotranspiration (SW-ET)] of a catchment in Denmark. Twenty-two scenarios are deﬁned, each having a simpliﬁed representation of a potential driver of spatial variability. A baseline model that incorporates full spatial detail is used to assess sensitivity. High sensitivity can be attested in scenarios where the simulated spatial patterns differ signiﬁcantly from the baseline. The core novelty of this study is that the analysis is based on a set of innovative spatial performance metrics that enable a reliable spatial pattern comparison. Overall, LST is very sensitive to air temperature and wind speed whereas ET is rather driven by vegetation. Both are sensitive to groundwater coupling and precipitation. The conclusions may be limited to the selected catchment and to the applied modeling system, but the suggested framework is generically relevant for the modeling community. While the applied metrics focus on speciﬁc spatial information, they partly exhibit redundant information. Thus, a combination of metrics is the ideal approach to evaluate spatial patterns in models outputs.},

Using cluster expansion techniques we expand the exact coarse-grained Hamiltonian around a ﬁrst approximation and derive higher accuracy schemes by including more terms in the expansion. The accuracy of the coarse-graining schemes is measured in terms of information loss, i.e., relative entropy, between the exact and approximate coarse-grained Gibbs measures. We test the effectiveness of our schemes in systems with competing short- and long-range interactions, using an analytically solvable model as a computational benchmark. Furthermore, the cluster expansion in Katsoulakis et al. [M.A. Katsoulakis, L. Rey-Bellet, P. Plecha´cˇ, D. Tsagkarogiannis, Coarse-graining schemes and a posteriori error estimates for stochastic lattice systems, M2AN Math. Model. Numer.

Based on these estimates we develop a numerical strategy to assess the quality of the coarse-graining and suitably reﬁne or coarsen the simulations.

However, detrimental impacts of more realistic schemes on the large-scale ﬂow have hindered progress in this area. Here we implement a total turbulent energy scheme into the climate model ECHAM6. The total turbulent energy scheme considers the effects of Earth’s rotation and static stability on the turbulence length scale. In contrast to the previously used turbulence scheme, the TTE scheme also implicitly represents entrainment ﬂux in a dry convective boundary layer. Reducing the previously exaggerated surface drag in stable boundary layers indeed causes an increase in southern hemispheric zonal winds and large-scale pressure gradients beyond observed values. These biases can be largely removed by increasing the parametrized orographic drag. Reducing the neutral limit turbulent Prandtl number warms and moistens low-latitude boundary layers and acts to reduce longstanding radiation biases in the stratocumulus regions, the Southern Ocean and the equatorial cold tongue that are common to many climate models.},

Using the UCLA-LES code with a traditional Smagorinsky-Lilly subgrid model and a simpliﬁed land-surface scheme, a sensitivity study to grid spacing is performed. At horizontal grid spacings ranging from 3.125 m in which we are capable of resolving most turbulence in the cases of interest to grid a spacing of 100 m which is clearly insufﬁcient to resolve the NBL, the ability of LES to represent the NBL and the inﬂuence of NBL biases on the subsequent daytime development of the convective boundary layer are examined. Although the low-resolution experiments produce substantial biases in the NBL, the inﬂuence on daytime convection is shown to be small, with biases in the afternoon boundary layer depth and temperature of approximately 100 m and 0.5 K, which partially cancel each other in terms of the mixed-layer top relative humidity.},

	abstract = {Yamaguchi and Feingold (2012) note that the cloud ﬁelds in their large-eddy simulations (LESs) of marine stratocumulus using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model exhibit a strong sensitivity to time stepping choices. In this study, we reproduce and analyze this sensitivity issue using two stratocumulus cases, one marine and one continental. Results show that (1) the sensitivity is associated with spurious motions near the moisture jump between the boundary layer and the free atmosphere, and (2) these spurious motions appear to arise from neglecting small variations in water vapor mixing ratio (qv) in the pressure gradient calculation in the acoustic substepping portion of the integration procedure. We show that this issue is remedied in the WRF dynamical core by replacing the prognostic equation for the potential temperature h with one for the moist potential temperature hm5h(1 1 1.61qv), which allows consistent treatment of moisture in the calculation of pressure during the acoustic substeps. With this modiﬁcation, the spurious motions and the sensitivity to the time stepping settings (i.e., the dynamic time step length and number of acoustic sub-steps) are eliminated in both of the example stratocumulus cases. This modiﬁcation improves the applicability of WRF for LES applications, and possibly other models using similar dynamical core formulations, and also permits the use of longer time steps than in the original code.},

	abstract = {Stratocumulus clouds are the most common type of boundary layer cloud; their radiative effects strongly modulate climate. Large eddy simulations (LES) of stratocumulus clouds often struggle to maintain ﬁdelity to observations because of the sharp gradients occurring at the entrainment interfacial layer at the cloud top. The challenge posed to LES by stratocumulus clouds is evident in the wide range of solutions found in the LES intercomparison based on the DYCOMS-II ﬁeld campaign, where simulated liquid water paths for identical initial and boundary conditions varied by a factor of nearly 12. Here we revisit the DYCOMS-II RF01 case and show that the wide range of previous LES results can be realized in a single LES code by varying only the numerical treatment of the equations of motion and the nature of subgrid-scale (SGS) closures. The simulations that maintain the greatest ﬁdelity to DYCOMS-II observations are identiﬁed. The results show that using weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) numerics for all resolved advective terms and no explicit SGS closure consistently produces the highest-ﬁdelity simulations. This suggests that the numerical dissipation inherent in WENO schemes functions as a high-quality, implicit SGS closure for this stratocumulus case. Conversely, using oscillatory centered difference numerical schemes for momentum advection, WENO numerics for scalars, and explicitly modeled SGS ﬂuxes consistently produces the lowest-ﬁdelity simulations. We attribute this to the production of anomalously large SGS ﬂuxes near the cloud tops through the interaction of numerical error in the momentum ﬁeld with the scalar SGS model.},

LES allows for a faster and more holistic study of the parameter space, but LES is sensitive to details of its formulation because the energetics are tied to unresolved processes in the cloud top region. One way to assess this sensitivity is through ﬁeld studies. Another way is through DNS. In particular, DNS can be used to test the hypothesis that LES, even with an inadequate representation of the physics of cloud top entrainment, properly quantiﬁes the sensitivity of cloud-topped boundary layers to changing environmental conditions. We support this argument by contrasting theoretical aspects of both techniques, by presenting ﬁrst DNS results of a stratocumulus-topped boundary layer and discussing their convergence toward Reynolds number similarity, and by showing the consistency of DNS results with LES results and ﬁeld measurements.},

The resulting entropy spectrum allows the assessment of the amount of information on different scales. The wavelet transformation and the most frequent-value method are used as ﬁlters for the decomposition. We also derive an analytical formula for estimation of the probability density function (PDF) of ﬁltered random surface parameters using the most frequent-value method. By analyzing the entropy spectrum of synthetic data, we derive rules for the interpretation of the entropy spectrum. We then apply them to real data and appraise, which scale of the heterogeneity is important for land surface and atmosphere interactions.},

	abstract = {The land-atmosphere system is characterized by pronounced land surface heterogeneity and vigorous atmospheric turbulence both covering a wide range of scales. The multiscale surface heterogeneities and multiscale turbulent eddies interact nonlinearly with each other. Understanding these multiscale processes quantitatively is essential to the subgrid parameterizations for weather and climate models. In this paper, we propose a method for surface heterogeneity quantiﬁcation and turbulence structure identiﬁcation. The ﬁrst part of the method is an orthogonal transform in the probability density function (PDF) domain, in contrast to the orthogonal wavelet transforms which are performed in the physical space. As the basis of the whole method, the orthogonal PDF transform (OPT) is used to asymptotically reconstruct the original signals by representing the signal values with multilevel approximations. The “patch” idea is then applied to these reconstructed ﬁelds in order to recognize areas at the land surface or in turbulent ﬂows that are of the same characteristics. A patch here is a connected area with the same approximation. For each recognized patch, a length scale is then deﬁned to build the energy spectrum. The OPT and related energy spectrum analysis, as a whole referred to as the orthogonal PDF decomposition (OPD), is applied to two-dimensional heterogeneous land surfaces and atmospheric turbulence ﬁelds for test. The results show that compared to the wavelet transforms, the OPD can reconstruct the original signal more effectively, and accordingly, its energy spectrum represents the signal’s multiscale variation more accurately. The method we propose in this paper is of general nature and therefore can be of interest for problems of multiscale process description in other geophysical disciplines.},

We mainly focus on how stratiﬁcation aﬀects the near-wall turbulence at moderate Reynolds numbers, i.e. Reτ = 360. A set of fully-resolved open channel ﬂow simulations is performed, where a stable stratiﬁcation has been introduced through a negative heat ﬂux at the lower wall. In agreement with previous studies, it is found that turbulence cannot be sustained for h/L values higher than 1.2, where L is the so-called Monin-Obukhov length and h is the height of the open channel. For smaller values, buoyancy does not re-laminarize the ﬂow, but nevertheless aﬀects the wall turbulence. Near-wall streaks are weakly aﬀected by stratiﬁcation, whereas the outer modes are increasingly damped as we move away from the wall. A decomposition of the wall-normal velocity is proposed in order to separate the gravity wave and turbulent ﬂow ﬁelds. This method has been tested both for open channel and full channel ﬂows. Gravity waves are likely to develop and to dominate close to the upper boundary (centerline for full channel). However, their intensity is weaker in the open channel, possibly due to the upper boundary condition. Moreover, the presence of internal gravity waves can also be deduced from a correlation analysis, which reveals (together with spanwise spectra) a narrowing of the outer structures as the stratiﬁcation is increased.},

	abstract = {A stratified bottom Ekman layer over a nonsloping, rough surface is studied using a three-dimensional unsteady large eddy simulation to examine the effects of an outer layer stratification on the boundary layer structure. When the flow field is initialized with a linear temperature profile, a three-layer structure develops with a mixed layer near the wall separated from a uniformly stratified outer layer by a pycnocline. With the free-stream velocity fixed, the wall stress increases slightly with the imposed stratification, but the primary role of stratification is to limit the boundary layer height. Ekman transport is generally confined to the mixed layer, which leads to larger cross-stream velocities and a larger surface veering angle when the flow is stratified. The rate of turning in the mixed layer is nearly independent of stratification, so that when stratification is large and the boundary layer thickness is reduced, the rate of veering in the pycnocline becomes very large. In the pycnocline, the mean shear is larger than observed in an unstratified boundary layer, which is explained using a buoyancy length scale, u*/N(z). This length scale leads to an explicit buoyancy-related modification to the log law for the mean velocity profile. A new method for deducing the wall stress based on observed mean velocity and density profiles is proposed and shows significant improvement compared to the standard profile method. A streamwise jet is observed near the center of the pycnocline, and the shear at the top of the jet leads to local shear instabilities and enhanced mixing in that region, despite the fact that the Richardson number formed using the mean density and shear profiles is larger than unity.},

The organization of convection into rolls was triggered by upstream heterogeneities in the surface temperature, representing ice and water. By changing the sea ice distribution in our LES, we were able to simulate a roll and a nonroll case for each scenario. Furthermore, the roll wavelength was varied by changing the scale of the heterogeneity. The characteristics of the simulated rolls and cloud streets, such as aspect ratios, orientation of the roll axes, and downstream extensions of single rolls agreed closely with observations in CAO situations. The vertical turbulent ﬂuxes, calculated for each simulation, were decomposed into contributions from rolls and from unorganized turbulence. Even though our results conﬁrmed that rolls triggered by upstream heterogeneities can substantially contribute to vertical turbulent ﬂuxes, the total ﬂuxes were not aﬀected by the rolls.},

	abstract = {The Arctic region is warming at a rate more than double the global average, a trend predicted to continue by all Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) climate models. Despite this consistency, signiﬁcant intermodel spread exists in the simulated Arctic climate related to differences in the Arctic surface radiation budget. Building upon previous work to characterize and understand surface radiation budget biases in climate models, the annual mean and seasonal cycle of the Arctic surface radiation budget in 17 CMIP5 models using the Historical-forcing scenario is evaluated against state-of-the-art Cloud and Earth’s Radiant Energy System Surface Energy Balanced and Filled data. The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble is found to simulate longwave surface ﬂuxes well during the sunlit months ({\textasciitilde}1 W mÀ2 differences in July) but exhibits signiﬁcant wintertime biases (up to À19 W mÀ2). Shortwave ﬂuxes show substantial across-model spread during summer; the model standard deviation approaches 20 W mÀ2 in July. Applying a decomposition analysis to the cloud radiative effect (CRE) seasonal cycles, an unrealistic compensation is uncovered between the model-simulated seasonal cycles of cloud fraction, all-sky/clear-sky ﬂux differences, and surface albedo that enables models to simulate realistic CRE seasonal cycles with unrealistic individual contributions. This unrealistic behavior in models must be constrained to improve Arctic climate simulation; observational uncertainty is sufﬁcient to do so. Lastly, biases in all and clear-sky longwave downwelling ﬂuxes positively correlate with model surface temperature in winter, while in summer surface temperature is most strongly related to clear-sky upwelling radiation biases from surface albedo errors.},

	abstract = {Land surface models incorporate a large number of process descriptions, containing a multitude of parameters. These parameters are typically read from tabulated input ﬁles. Some of these parameters might be ﬁxed numbers in the computer code though, which hinder model agility during calibration. Here we identiﬁed 139 hard-coded parameters in the model code of the Noah land surface model with multiple process options (Noah-MP). We performed a Sobol’ global sensitivity analysis of Noah-MP for a speciﬁc set of process options, which includes 42 out of the 71 standard parameters and 75 out of the 139 hard-coded parameters. The sensitivities of the hydrologic output ﬂuxes latent heat and total runoﬀ as well as their component ﬂuxes were evaluated at 12 catchments within the United States with very diﬀerent hydrometeorological regimes. Noah-MP’s hydrologic output ﬂuxes are sensitive to two thirds of its applicable standard parameters (i.e., Sobol’ indexes above 1\%). The most sensitive parameter is, however, a hard-coded value in the formulation of soil surface resistance for direct evaporation, which proved to be oversensitive in other land surface models as well. Surface runoﬀ is sensitive to almost all hard-coded parameters of the snow processes and the meteorological inputs. These parameter sensitivities diminish in total runoﬀ. Assessing these parameters in model calibration would require detailed snow observations or the calculation of hydrologic signatures of the runoﬀ data. Latent heat and total runoﬀ exhibit very similar sensitivities because of their tight coupling via the water balance. A calibration of Noah-MP against either of these ﬂuxes should therefore give comparable results. Moreover, these ﬂuxes are sensitive to both plant and soil parameters. Calibrating, for example, only soil parameters hence limit the ability to derive realistic model parameters. It is thus recommended to include the most sensitive hard-coded model parameters that were exposed in this study when calibrating Noah-MP.},

	abstract = {We present a method using Doppler lidar data for identifying the main sources of turbulent mixing within the atmospheric boundary layer. The method identiﬁes the presence of turbulence and then assigns a turbulent source by combining several lidar quantities: attenuated backscatter coeﬃcient, vertical velocity skewness, dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, and vector wind shear. Both buoyancy–driven and shear–driven situations are identiﬁed, and the method operates in both clear–sky and cloud–topped conditions, with some reservations in precipitation. To capture the full seasonal cycle, the classiﬁcation method was applied to more than one year of data from two sites, Hyytiälä, Finland, and Jülich, Germany. Analysis showed seasonal variation in the diurnal cycle at both sites; a clear diurnal cycle was observed in spring, summer, and autumn seasons, but due to their respective latitudes, a weaker cycle in winter at Jülich, and almost non–existent at Hyytiälä. Additionally, there are signiﬁcant contributions from sources other than convective mixing, with cloud–driven mixing being observed even within the ﬁrst 500 m above ground. Also evident is the considerable amount of nocturnal mixing within the lowest 500 m at both sites, especially during the winter. The presence of a low–level jet was often detected when sources of nocturnal mixing were diagnosed as wind–shear. The classiﬁcation scheme, and the climatology extracted from the classiﬁcation, provide insight into the processes responsible for mixing within the atmospheric boundary layer, how variable in space and time these can be, and how they vary with location.},

	abstract = {The behavior of sensible heat ﬂux H with stability parameter ζ in the stable atmospheric surface layer is analyzed within the framework of Monin‐Obukhov similarity theory (MOST). Using MOST equations, H is expressed as a function of ζ and wind shear ∂U/∂z. A systematic mathematical analysis is carried out to analyze the behavior of H with ζ utilizing the linear as well as various nonlinear empirical functional forms of the similarity functions. In case of linear form, for a given value of H, two different values of ζ along with the “downward heat ﬂux maximum” with a unique critical point are found to occur. However, for the other selected empirical similarity functions, more than two values of ζ having the same magnitude of H may occur suggesting the existence of multiple critical points. Further, the observational variation of H with ζ is analyzed using data from three different sites. Data suggest the existence of two different stability regimes for the same magnitude of heat ﬂux. However, the data do not support the existence of multiple values of ζ for the same magnitude of H, as predicted by MOST with the other selected empirical forms of similarity functions. This suggests that the phenomenon of existence of downward heat ﬂux maximum, as predicted by MOST equations, depends on the functional form of the similarity functions, and it appears to break down for some selected empirical forms of similarity functions under very stable conditions.},

	abstract = {We incorporated a single-layer urban canopy model into a simple two-dimensional atmospheric model in order to describe the fundamental impact of the urban canopy model on an idealized urban heat island simulation. We found that the heat island circulation developed less strongly than when using the atmospheric model with the standard slab urban model. Additionally, the coupling with urban canopy model (i) delays the phase of surface air temperature, (ii) reduces the diurnal range of the temperature, and (iii) produces a nocturnal heat island, which results from the difference in atmospheric stability between city and its surroundings. The features from the atmospheric model coupled with the canopy model agree well with those from observation, although the atmospheric model with the slab model does not. The simulated nocturnal heat island is caused by the larger heat storage of the canopy model which releases sensible heat after sunset.},

This organism possesses a network of tubular elements, by means of which nutrients and signals circulate through the plasmodium. When the organism is put in a maze, the network changes its shape to connect two exits by the shortest path. This process of path-ﬁnding is attributed to an underlying physiological mechanism: a tube thickens as the ﬂux through it increases. The experimental evidence for this is, however, only qualitative. We constructed a mathematical model of the general form of the tube dynamics. Our model contains a key parameter corresponding to the extent of the feedback regulation between the thickness of a tube and the ﬂux through it. We demonstrate the dependence of the behavior of the model on this parameter.},

Measurements show enhanced wake effects in the SABL compared to the unstable situation. Another inﬂuence on the power generation of an offshore wind farm is the distance of the wind farm to the shore. This is accounted for in the LES by a modiﬁcation of surface characteristics at the coastal discontinuity. In addition to the effect of the coast, the numerical case study also shows the existence of local jets between the turbines of the wind farm.},

The asymptotic variations with distance normal to the plane are found for functions representing the important properties of the motion, and, in particular, the energy of the fluctuations is shown to be inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance from the plane.

	volume = {129},
	abstract = {A number of short-term numerical experiments conducted by the Penn State–NCAR ﬁfth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5) coupled with an advanced land surface model, alongside the simulations coupled with a simple slab model, are veriﬁed with observations. For clear sky day cases, the MM5 model gives reasonable estimates of radiation forcing at the surface with solar radiation being slightly overestimated probably due to the lack of aerosol treatment in the current MM5 radiation scheme. The improvements in the calculation of surface latent and sensible heat ﬂuxes with the new land surface model (LSM) are very apparent, and more importantly, the new LSM captures the correct Bowen ratio. Evaporation obtained from the simple slab model is signiﬁcantly lower than observations. Having time-varying soil moisture is important for capturing even short-term evolution of evaporation. Due to the more reasonable diurnal cycle of surface heat ﬂuxes in the MM5–LSM, its nearsurface temperature and humidity are closer to the FIFE observations. In particular, the MM5–slab model has a systematic warm bias in 2-m temperature. Both the slab model and the new LSM were coupled with the nonlocal Medium-Range Forecast model PBL parameterization scheme and they reproduced the depth of the morning surface inversion in the stable boundary layer well. The observed mixed layer in the late morning deepens faster than both models, despite the fact that both models have high bias in surface sensible heat ﬂuxes. Presumably, such a rapid development of convective mixed layer is due to some effects induced by small-scale heterogeneity or large-scale advection that the MM5 failed to capture. Both surface models reasonably reproduce the daytime convective PBL growth and, in general, the temperature difference between the two models and observations is less than 2Њ. The simulations of two rainfall events are not conclusive. Both models produce a good forecast of rainfall for 24 June 1997 and have similar problems for the event of 4 July 1997, although the simulations with the new LSM have slightly improved results in some 3-h rainfall accumulations. It seems that the new LSM does not have unexpected inﬂuences in situations for which the land surface processes are secondary, but that it may have subtle, though complex, effects on the model behavior because of heterogeneity introduced by soil moisture, vegetation effects, and soil type, which are all lacking in the slab model.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses and documents a number of issues related to the implementation of an advanced land surface–hydrology model in the Penn State–NCAR ﬁfth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5). The concept adopted here is that the land surface model should be able to provide not only reasonable diurnal variations of surface heat ﬂuxes as surface boundary conditions for coupled models, but also correct seasonal evolutions of soil moisture in the context of a long-term data assimilation system. In a similar way to that in which the modiﬁed Oregon State University land surface model (LSM) has been used in the NCEP global and regional forecast models, it is implemented in MM5 to facilitate the initialization of soil moisture. Also, 1-km resolution vegetation and soil texture maps are introduced in the coupled MM5–LSM system to help identify vegetation/ water/soil characteristics at ﬁne scales and capture the feedback of these land surface forcings. A monthly varying climatological 0.15Њ ϫ 0.15Њ green vegetation fraction is utilized to represent the annual control of vegetation on the surface evaporation. Speciﬁcation of various vegetation and soil parameters is discussed, and the available water capacity in the LSM is extended to account for subgrid-scale heterogeneity. The coupling of the LSM to MM5 is also sensitive to the treatment of the surface layer, especially the calculation of the roughness length for heat/moisture. Including the effect of the molecular sublayer can improve the simulation of surface heat ﬂux. It is shown that the soil thermal and hydraulic conductivities and the surface energy balance are very sensitive to soil moisture changes. Hence, it is necessary to establish an appropriate soil moisture data assimilation system to improve the soil moisture initialization at ﬁne scales.},

The procedure is demonstrated analytically and numerically for a one-dimensional, idealized heat source and moisture sink associated with moist convection.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a revised vertical diffusion package with a nonlocal turbulent mixing coefficient in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Based on the study of Noh et al. and accumulated results of the behavior of the Hong and Pan algorithm, a revised vertical diffusion algorithm that is suitable for weather forecasting and climate prediction models is developed. The major ingredient of the revision is the inclusion of an explicit treatment of entrainment processes at the top of the PBL. The new diffusion package is called the Yonsei University PBL (YSU PBL). In a one-dimensional offline test framework, the revised scheme is found to improve several features compared with the Hong and Pan implementation. The YSU PBL increases boundary layer mixing in the thermally induced free convection regime and decreases it in the mechanically induced forced convection regime, which alleviates the well-known problems in the MediumRange Forecast (MRF) PBL. Excessive mixing in the mixed layer in the presence of strong winds is resolved. Overly rapid growth of the PBL in the case of the Hong and Pan is also rectified. The scheme has been successfully implemented in the Weather Research and Forecast model producing a more realistic structure of the PBL and its development. In a case study of a frontal tornado outbreak, it is found that some systematic biases of the large-scale features such as an afternoon cold bias at 850 hPa in the MRF PBL are resolved. Consequently, the new scheme does a better job in reproducing the convective inhibition. Because the convective inhibition is accurately predicted, widespread light precipitation ahead of a front, in the case of the MRF PBL, is reduced. In the frontal region, the YSU PBL scheme improves some characteristics, such as a double line of intense convection. This is because the boundary layer from the YSU PBL scheme remains less diluted by entrainment leaving more fuel for severe convection when the front triggers it.},

	abstract = {The diurnal and seasonal variations of the northern Australian dryline are examined by constructing climatologies of low-level dynamic and thermodynamic variables taken from the high-resolution Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Limited Area Prediction Scheme (LAPS) forecasts from 2000 to 2003. The development of the dryline is analyzed within the framework of the frontogenesis function applied to the mixing ratio and the airstream diagnostics of Cohen and Schultz. A case study of 12–13 October 2002 illustrating the airmass boundaries over the Australian region is also examined. Daytime surface heating produces sea-breeze circulations around the coast and a large inland heat trough that extends east–west along northern Australia. At night, air parcels accelerate toward low pressure, increasing convergence and deformation within the heat trough. This sharpens the moisture gradient across the tropical and continental airmass boundary into a dryline. This is different than the dryline of the Great Plains in the United States, which generally weakens overnight. The Australian dryline is strongest in spring just poleward of the Gulf of Carpentaria, where the moisture gradient across the heat trough is enhanced by the coast, and the axis of dilatation is closely aligned with mixing ratio isopleths. The dryline is weakest in winter, when the heat trough is weak. The LAPS 3-h forecasts are in good agreement with observations obtained from the Automatic Weather Station network. The 3-h forecasts capture the observed diurnal and seasonal cycle of the airmass boundaries. However, the sea-breeze circulation and ageostrophic flow into the surface heat trough is limited by the model resolution. The LAPS 3-h forecasts may therefore underestimate the nocturnal intensification of the dryline, especially since the inland moisture content is overestimated.},

Although the stability parameter, z /L, is inversely dependent on the mean wind speed, the speed of the large-scale flow includes independent influences on the flux–gradient relationship. The dimensionless mean wind shear is found to obey existing stability functions when z /L is less than unity, particularly for the strong and intermediate wind classes. For weak mean winds and/or strong stability (z /L Ͼ 1), this similarity theory breaks down. Deviations from similarity theory are examined in terms of intermittency.

Both LESs are driven under the same environmental conditions, allowed to interact with each other, and expected to behave the same statistically. The first experiment of the free-convective PBL reveals a mean temperature bias between the two LES domains, which generates a nonzero mean vertical velocity in the nest domain while the mean vertical velocity averaged over the outer domain remains zero. The problem occurs when the horizontal extent of the nest domain is too small to capture an adequate sample of energy-containing eddies; this problem can be alleviated using a nest domain that is at least 5 times the PBL depth in both x and y. The second experiment of the neutral PBL exposes a bias in the prediction of the surface stress between the two LES domains, which is found due to the grid dependence of the Smagorinsky-type subgrid-scale (SGS) model. A new two-part SGS model is developed to solve this problem.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This study investigates nonlinear waves ahead of cold fronts in the Great Australian Bight, south of the Australian continent. These waves often form a series of roll clouds on their crests analogous to the “morning glory,” which is observed around the Gulf of Carpentaria in northeastern Australia. High-resolution visible satellite imagery from NASA’s polar-orbiting Aqua and Terra satellites between 23 October 2004 and 29 February 2008 is used to determine how frequently these cloud lines occur ahead of cold fronts. A total of 14 cases are identified with the most cases occurring in summer and none occurring in winter. The authors hypothesize that the summer maximum is due to a combination of lower cloud amounts associated with summertime cold fronts, and a stronger maritime stable layer, which is produced as hot continental air, is advected offshore.
            Three cloud line events are modeled using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU–NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5, version 3.6). In each case the low-level divergence field reveals convergence lines, which coincide with the cloud lines as identified on the satellite images. In two cases vertical cross sections of virtual potential temperature and horizontal and vertical velocity through the disturbances show a cold front advancing into a stratified environment leading to wave production at the leading edge of the cold air mass. Modeled maximal upward velocities range between 0.8 and 2.5 m s−1. Surface pressure jumps of about 1 hPa associated with the propagating waves occur in each case, which coincides with that predicted by simple bore theory. In two cases the front moves at supercritical speed (i.e., the frontal speed is larger than the speed of the fastest mode of small-amplitude long waves). In the third case the front does not propagate and the nonlinear waves produced become stationary as well.},

In this study, 1D and 2D scale-selective ﬁlters have been implemented using a convolution-based scheme, since a convolution can be readily evaluated in terms of CCAM’s native conformal cubic coordinates. The downscaling accuracy of 1D and 2D scale-selective ﬁlters is evaluated after downscaling NCEP Global Forecast System analyses for 2006 from 200-km resolution to 60-km resolution over Australia. The 1D scale-selective ﬁlter scheme was found to downscale the analyses with similar accuracy to a 2D ﬁlter but required signiﬁcantly fewer computations. The 1D and 2D scale-selective ﬁlters were also found to downscale the analyses more accurately than a far-ﬁeld nudging scheme (i.e., analogous to a boundary-value nudging approach). It is concluded that when the model is required to reproduce the host model behavior above a speciﬁed length scale then the use of an appropriately designed 1D scale-selective ﬁlter can be a computationally efﬁcient approach to dynamical downscaling for models having a cube-based geometry.},

	abstract = {This study analyzes the effects of land surface heterogeneities at various horizontal scales on the transition from shallow to deep convection and on the cloud size distribution. An idealized case of midlatitude summertime convection is simulated by means of large-eddy simulations coupled to an interactive land surface. The transition is accelerated over heterogeneous surfaces. The simulation with an intermediate patch size of 12.8 km exhibits the fastest transition with a transition time two-thirds that over a homogeneous surface. A similar timing is observed for the precipitation onset whereas the total accumulated rainfall tends to increase with patch size. The cloud size distribution can be approximated by a power law with a scale break. The exponent of the power law is independent of the heterogeneity scale, implying a similar cloud cover between the simulations. In contrast, the scale break varies with patch size. The size of the largest clouds does not scale with the boundary layer height, although their maximum size scales with the patch size. Finally, the idea that larger clouds grow faster, known from homogeneous surface conditions, is not fully valid over heterogeneous surfaces. These various aspects can be understood from the complex interplay between the characteristics of the triggered mesoscale circulations and a cloud development acting in response to the diurnal cycle in surface heating. The results also call for adequate representation of such effects in convective parameterizations.},

In this paper, we describe the physiological basis and the formulation of the model, as well as the results of simulations of some complicated networks. The path-ﬁnding method used by Physarum is a good example of cellular computation.},

	abstract = {The quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE) theory is an analytical spectral theory of turbulence based upon successive elimination of small scales of motion and calculating ensuing corrections to the viscosity and diffusivity. The main results of the theory are analytical expressions for eddy viscosity, eddy diffusivity, and kinetic energy and temperature spectra. Partial scale elimination yields a subgrid-scale representation for large-eddy simulations, whereas the elimination of all ﬂuctuating scales is analogous to the Reynolds averaging. The scale-dependent analysis enables one to put processes on different scales at the spotlight and elucidate their contributions to eddy viscosities and eddy diffusivities. In addition, the method traces the modiﬁcation of the ﬂow with increasing stratiﬁcation and recovers growing anisotropy and the effect of the internal waves. The QNSE-based Reynolds-averaged models present a viable alternative to conventional Reynolds stress models. A QNSE model of this kind was tested in the numerical weather prediction system HIRLAM instead of the existing reference Reynolds stress model. The performance of the QNSE model was superior in all simulations where stable stratiﬁcation was noticeable.},

	abstract = {Under-resolved computer simulations are typically unavoidable in many practical turbulent ﬂow applications exhibiting extreme geometrical complexity and broad ranges of length and time scales. In such applications, coarse-grained simulation (CGS) becomes the effective simulation strategy, mostly by necessity rather than by choice. In CGS strategies, resolved/unresolved scale separation is assumed possible, large energy-containing structures are mostly resolved, smaller structures are spatially ﬁltered out and unresolved subgrid effects are modeled; this includes classical large-eddy simulation (LES) strategies with the explicit use of closure subgrid scale models and implicit LES, relying on subgrid modeling implicitly provided by physics-capturing numerical algorithms. Predictability issues in CGS of under-resolved mixing of material scalars driven by under-resolved velocity ﬁelds and initial conditions are addressed in this paper, and shock-driven turbulent mixing is a particular focus.},

	abstract = {Theories of convection from maintained and instantaneous sources of buoyancy are developed, using methods which are applicable to stratified body fluids with any variation of density with height; detailed solutions have been presented for the case of a stably stratified fluid with a linear density gradient. The three main assumptions involved are (i) that the profiles of vertical velocity and buoyancy are similar at all heights, (ii) that the rate of entrainment of fluid at any height is proportional to a characteristic velocity at that height, and (iii) that the fluids are incompressible and do not change volume on mixing, and that local variations in density throughout the motion are small compared to some reference density. The governing equations are derived in non-dimensional form from the conditions of conservation of volume, momentum and buoyancy, and a numerical solution is obtained for the case of the maintained source, This leads to a prediction of the final height to which a plume of light fluid will rise in a stably stratified fluid. Estimates of the constant governing the rate of entrainment are made by comparing the theory with some previous results in uniform fluids, and with the results of new experiments carried out in a stratified salt solution. For the case of an instantaneous source of buoyancy there is an exact solution; the entrainment constant is again estimated from laboratory results for a stratified fluid Finally, the analysis is applied to the (compressible) atmosphere, by making the customary substitution of potential temperature for temperature. Predictions are made of the height to which smoke plumes from typical sources of heat should rise in a still, stably stratified atmosphere under various conditions.},

	abstract = {The two main principles underlying the use of isentropic maps of potential vorticity to represent dynamical processes in the atmosphere are reviewed, including the extension of those principles to take the lower boundary condition into account. The first is the familiar Lagrangian conservation principle, for potential vorticity (PV) and potential temperature, which holds approximately when advective processes dominate frictional and diabatic ones. The second is the principle of ‘invertibility’ of the PV distribution, which holds whether or not diabatic and frictional processes are important. The invertibility principle states that if the total mass under each isentropic surface is specified, then a knowledge of the global distribution of PV on each isentropic surface and of potential temperature at the lower boundary (which within certain limitations can be considered to be part of the PV distribution) is sufficient to deduce, diagnostically, all the other dynamical fields, such as winds, temperatures, geopotential heights, static stabilities, and vertical velocities, under a suitable balance condition. The statement that vertical velocities can be deduced is related to the well-known omega equation principle, and depends on having sufficient information about diabatic and frictional processes. Quasi-geostrophic, semigeostrophic, and ‘nonlinear normal mode initialization’ realizations of the balance condition are discussed. An important constraint on the mass-weighted integral of PV over a material volume and on its possible diabatic and frictional change is noted.},

	abstract = {A prognostic three-dimensional mesoscale model has been developed and used in one- and two-dimensional modes to evaluate ten local turbulence closure schemes. The schemes ranged from ﬁrst-order to the two-equation prognostic schemes. Predictions by the models were compared for a one-dimensional convective boundary layer using mixed layer scaling and measurements to interpret the results. Two-dimensional simulations were also performed for a sea-breeze ﬂow and for ﬂow over a hill. The results showed that for all of the models considered, minor differences were produced in the mean meteorological ﬁelds and in the vertical scalar ﬂuxes, but major differences were apparent in the velocity variances and dissipation rate. Predicted tracer concentrations were very sensitive to the turbulence model formulation for dispersion from a point source in the convective boundary layer, particularly for the prediction of maximum concentrations. Predicted tracer concentrations from a surface volume source for the two-dimensional simulations were similar for all models, although the degree of mixing in the morning growth period produced some differences. Generally, good results for the mean meteorological ﬁelds can be obtained with ﬁrst-order schemes, even if they underpredict the magnitude of turbulence in the convective boundary layer, and reasonable tracer concentrations can also be obtained with these models provided near-source effects are not important. The two-equation prognostic models performed best for the prediction of turbulence in the convective boundary layer.},

The simulations are made using the Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) with the initial and boundary conditions taken from the operational analyses of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts. These simulations are compared with the observations of two cold fronts taken during the Central Australian Fronts Experiment in 1991. The simulations show a number of features that have been suspected, but never conﬁrmed or quantiﬁed. (i) Although the wind ﬁeld in the boundary layer is frontogenetic, daytime turbulent mixing is strongly frontolytic, which accounts for the weakening and deceleration of the fronts during the late morning and afternoon when convective mixing in the boundary layer is most vigorous. (ii) When the mixing subsides in the early evening, the low-level winds increase along with the deformation and convergence, leading to a strengthening and acceleration of the fronts. (iii) Bore-like disturbances are generated during the early hours of the morning as the nocturnal inversion strengthens. These bores propagate ahead of the front, developing a series of large-amplitude waves at their leading edge.},

	abstract = {Note that the time periods isolated in clusters 1 and 3 are characterized by weak stability, whereas the time periods in clusters 2 and 4 are characterized by strong stability. Figure 3 shows that the heat ﬂux cospectra vary smoothly with scale in the periods characterized by weak stability conditions extracted from clusters 1 and 3. In those periods, the presence of a negative peak in the cospectra followed by a decrease of the ﬂux magnitude and levelling off of the heat ﬂux is clearly apparent and associated with turbulent transport. The turbulent scales inferred from the cospectra appear to be smaller than approximately 200 s for the example in cluster 1 and smaller than approximately 400 s for the example in cluster 3, both time-scales corresponding to the levelling off of the MRD cospectra in Figure 3. Note that this result implies that the choice of 1 min averaging windows used in the clustering procedure discards some of the turbulent contributions to the vertical velocity ﬂuctuations in clusters 1 and 3. The time-scale 1/NBV associated with the Brunt–Va¨isa¨la¨ frequency NBV = \{(g/T)(dT/dz)\}1/2 is 11 s in the example of cluster 1 and 61 s in the example of cluster 3. The distribution of the total ﬂux is very different in the periods extracted from clusters 2 and 4. One can still see a slight negative peak followed by a decrease of the ﬂux magnitude and levelling off probably due to turbulent transport in those periods, but it is associated with smaller scales (generally faster than 20 s for both examples) and the magnitude of the corresponding ﬂux is very small. Larger scales of motions (slower than 20 s in these examples) have stronger contributions to the total ﬂux. In these two examples, the time-scale 1/NBV is approximately 3.7 s (cluster 2) and 3.8 s (cluster 4).},

	abstract = {A new algorithm for generating synthetic Landsat images is developed based on all available Landsat data. This algorithm is capable of predicting Landsat surface reﬂectance for any desired date. It ﬁrst excludes cloud, cloud shadow, and snow observations, and then uses the remaining clear observations to estimate time series models for each Landsat pixel. Three time series models (a simple model, advanced model, and full model) are used for estimating surface reﬂectance for each pixel, and the selection of a time series model is dependent on the number of clear observations available: the more clear observations, the more complex the model will be that is used. For each time series model there are three components (seasonality, trend, and breaks), that are used for modeling intra-annual and inter-annual differences and abrupt surface change. Abrupt surface changes are detected by differencing predicted and observed Landsat observations, and if the difference is larger than twice the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for six consecutive observations, it will be detected as a “break” in the time series model. The RMSE values are temporally adjusted to provide better threshold range. For each “synthetic” image, a Quality Assessment (QA) Band is provided that contains information on how the time series model was estimated and used for generating the synthetic data. We have applied this approach to six Landsat scenes within the United States. We visually compared the synthetic images with real Landsat images for different kinds of environments and they are similar for all image pairs. We also quantitatively assessed the accuracy of the synthetic data by calculating the RMSE value for all clear Landsat observations. The RMSE values for the three visible bands are the lowest (approximately 0.01), and the Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) bands are slightly higher in magnitude (between 0.01 and 0.02). The Near Infrared (NIR) band has the highest RMSE values (between 0.02 and 0.03). The goal of this paper is to provide Landsat images that are free of cloud, cloud shadow, snow, and Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off gaps that can be used to derive land cover and bio-physical products.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric gravity waves have been a subject of intense research activity in recent years because of their myriad eﬀects and their major contributions to atmospheric circulation, structure, and variability. Apart from occasionally strong lower-atmospheric eﬀects, the major wave inﬂuences occur in the middle atmosphere, between ∼ 10 and 110 km altitudes, because of decreasing density and increasing wave amplitudes with altitude. Theoretical, numerical, and observational studies have advanced our understanding of gravity waves on many fronts since the review by Fritts [1984a]; the present review will focus on these more recent contributions. Progress includes a better appreciation of gravity wave sources and characteristics, the evolution of the gravity wave spectrum with altitude and with variations of wind and stability, the character and implications of observed climatologies, and the wave interaction and instability processes that constrain wave amplitudes and spectral shape. Recent studies have also expanded dramatically our understanding of gravity wave inﬂuences on the large-scale circulation and the thermal and constituent structures of the middle atmosphere. These advances have led to a number of parameterizations of gravity wave eﬀects which are enabling ever more realistic descriptions of gravity wave forcing in large-scale models. There remain, nevertheless, a number of areas in which further progress is needed in reﬁning our understanding of and our ability to describe and predict gravity wave inﬂuences in the middle atmosphere. Our view of these unknowns and needs is also oﬀered.},

	abstract = {Flow in a stably stratiﬁed environment is characterized by anisotropic and intermittent turbulence and wavelike motions of varying amplitudes and periods. Understanding turbulence intermittency and wave-turbulence interactions in a stably stratiﬁed ﬂow remains a challenging issue in geosciences including planetary atmospheres and oceans. The stable atmospheric boundary layer (SABL) commonly occurs when the ground surface is cooled by longwave radiation emission such as at night over land surfaces, or even daytime over snow and ice surfaces, and when warm air is advected over cold surfaces. Intermittent turbulence intensiﬁcation in the SABL impacts human activities and weather variability, yet it cannot be generated in state-of-the-art numerical forecast models. This failure is mainly due to a lack of understanding of the physical mechanisms for seemingly random turbulence generation in a stably stratiﬁed ﬂow, in which wave-turbulence interaction is a potential mechanism for turbulence intermittency. A workshop on wave-turbulence interactions in the SABL addressed the current understanding and challenges of wave-turbulence interactions and the role of wavelike motions in contributing to anisotropic and intermittent turbulence from the perspectives of theory, observations, and numerical parameterization. There have been a number of reviews on waves, and a few on turbulence in stably stratiﬁed ﬂows, but not much on wave-turbulence interactions. This review focuses on the nocturnal SABL; however, the discussions here on intermittent turbulence and wave-turbulence interactions in stably stratiﬁed ﬂows underscore important issues in stably stratiﬁed geophysical dynamics in general.},

	abstract = {Persistent episodes of extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere summer have been associated with high-amplitude quasi-stationary atmospheric Rossby waves, with zonal wave numbers 6 to 8 resulting from the phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA). A fingerprint for the occurrence of QRA can be defined in terms of the zonally averaged surface temperature field. Examining state-of-the-art [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)] climate model projections, we find that QRA events are likely to increase by {\textasciitilde}50\% this century under business-as-usual carbon emissions, but there is considerable variation among climate models. Some predict a near tripling of QRA events by the end of the century, while others predict a potential decrease. Models with amplified Arctic warming yield the most pronounced increase in QRA events. The projections are strongly dependent on assumptions regarding the nature of changes in radiative forcing associated with anthropogenic aerosols over the next century. One implication of our findings is that a reduction in midlatitude aerosol loading could actually lead to Arctic de-amplification this century, ameliorating potential increases in persistent extreme weather events.},

First, the constraints are represented by means of a full weak space-time formulation as a linear system in 2 in wavelet coordinates, following a recent approach by Schwab and Stevenson. Second, a quadratic cost functional involving a tracking-type term for the state and a regularization term for the distributed control is also formulated in terms of 2 sequence norms of wavelet coordinates. This functional serves as a representer for a functional involving diﬀerent Sobolev norms with possibly nonintegral smoothness parameter. Standard techniques from optimization are then used to derive the ﬁrst order necessary conditions as a coupled system in 2-coordinates. For this purpose, an adaptive method is proposed, which can be interpreted as an inexact gradient method for the control. In each iteration step, the primal and adjoint systems are solved up to a prescribed accuracy by the adaptive algorithm. It is shown that the adaptive algorithm converges. Moreover, the algorithm is proved to be asymptotically optimal: the convergence rate achieved for computing each of the components of the solution (state, adjoint state, and control) up to a desired target tolerance is asymptotically the same as the wavelet best N -term approximation of each solution component, and the total computational work is proportional to the number of computational unknowns.},

	abstract = {Rapid developments in geographical information systems (GIS) continue to generate interest in analyzing complex spatial datasets. One area of activity is in creating smoothed disease maps to describe the geographic variation of disease and generate hypotheses for apparent differences in risk. With multiple diseases, a multivariate conditionally autoregressive (MCAR) model is often used to smooth across space while accounting for associations between the diseases. The MCAR, however, imposes complex covariance structures that are difficult to interpret and estimate. This article develops a much simpler alternative approach building upon the techniques of smoothed ANOVA (SANOVA). Instead of simply shrinking effects without any structure, here we use SANOVA to smooth spatial random effects by taking advantage of the spatial structure. We extend SANOVA to cases in which one factor is a spatial lattice, which is smoothed using a CAR model, and a second factor is, for example, type of cancer. Datasets routinely lack enough information to identify the additional structure of MCAR. SANOVA offers a simpler and more intelligible structure than the MCAR while performing as well. We demonstrate our approach with simulation studies designed to compare SANOVA with different design matrices versus MCAR with different priors. Subsequently a cancer-surveillance dataset, describing incidence of 3-cancers in Minnesota’s 87 counties, is analyzed using both approaches, showing the competitiveness of the SANOVA approach.},

Based on an extensive interpretive literature survey and new eddy correlation data for the stable boundary layer, this study deﬁnes two prototype stable boundary layers: the weakly stable case and the very stable case. The weakly stable boundary layer is amenable to existing models. The very stable boundary layer eludes modeling attempts due to breakdown of existing formulations of turbulence and due to features found in the atmosphere which are not normally included in models. The latter includes clear-air radiative cooling, low-level jets, surface heterogeneity, gravity waves, meandering motions, and other mesoscale motions which propagate from outside the local domain. While these mechanisms are not essential to understanding idealized or laboratory versions of the stable boundary layer, they complicate comparisons of numerical models and theories with actual atmospheric boundary layers. Statistics which describe various features of the stable boundary layer are offered for future comparison with modeling results.},

High-order numerical schemes suitable for direct numerical simulations in the compressible and Boussinesq limits are described, and simulations are presented to validate the incompressible approach.

	abstract = {Some time ago, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) was proposed as a new veriﬁcation tool for (probabilistic) forecast systems. Its focus is on the entire permissible range of a certain (weather) parameter. The CRPS can be seen as a ranked probability score with an inﬁnite number of classes, each of zero width. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as the integral of the Brier score over all possible threshold values for the parameter under consideration. For a deterministic forecast system the CRPS reduces to the mean absolute error. In this paper it is shown that for an ensemble prediction system the CRPS can be decomposed into a reliability part and a resolution/uncertainty part, in a way that is similar to the decomposition of the Brier score. The reliability part of the CRPS is closely connected to the rank histogram of the ensemble, while the resolution/ uncertainty part can be related to the average spread within the ensemble and the behavior of its outliers. The usefulness of such a decomposition is illustrated for the ensemble prediction system running at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The evaluation of the CRPS and its decomposition proposed in this paper can be extended to systems issuing continuous probability forecasts, by realizing that these can be interpreted as the limit of ensemble forecasts with an inﬁnite number of members.},

During ET a cyclone frequently produces intense rainfall and strong winds and has increased forward motion, so that such systems pose a serious threat to land and maritime activities. Changes in the structure of a system as it evolves from a tropical to an extratropical cyclone during ET necessitate changes in forecast strategies. In this paper a brief climatology of ET is given and the challenges associated with forecasting extratropical transition are described in terms of the forecast variables (track, intensity, surface winds, precipitation) and their impacts (ﬂooding, bush ﬁres, ocean response). The problems associated with the numerical prediction of ET are discussed. A comprehensive review of the current understanding of the processes involved in ET is presented. Classiﬁcations of extratropical transition are described and potential vorticity thinking is presented as an aid to understanding ET. Further sections discuss the interaction between a tropical cyclone and the midlatitude environment, the role of latent heat release, convection and the underlying surface in ET, the structural changes due to frontogenesis, the mechanisms responsible for precipitation, and the energy budget during ET. Finally, a summary of the future directions for research into ET is given.},

	abstract = {An intentional yaw misalignment of wind turbines is currently discussed as one possibility to increase the overall energy yield of wind farms. The idea behind this control is to decrease wake losses of downstream turbines by altering the wake trajectory of the controlled upwind turbines. For an application of such an operational control, precise knowledge about the inﬂow wind conditions, the magnitude of wake deﬂection by a yawed turbine and the propagation of the wake is crucial. The dependency of the wake deﬂection on the ambient wind conditions as well as the uncertainty of its trajectory are not sufﬁciently covered in current wind farm control models. In this study we analyze multiple sources that contribute to the uncertainty of the estimation of the wake deﬂection downstream of yawed wind turbines in different ambient wind conditions. We ﬁnd that the wake shapes and the magnitude of deﬂection differ in the three evaluated atmospheric boundary layers of neutral, stable and unstable thermal stability. Uncertainty in the wake deﬂection estimation increases for smaller temporal averaging intervals. We also consider the choice of the method to deﬁne the wake center as a source of uncertainty as it modiﬁes the result. The variance of the wake deﬂection estimation increases with decreasing atmospheric stability. Control of the wake position in a highly convective environment is therefore not recommended.},

The turbulent fields are obtained directly by solving the three-dimensional time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations (using the Boussinesq approximation to account for buoyancy effects), and no turbulence model is needed. Two levels of heating are considered, one quite vigorous, the other more moderate. Statistics for the vigorously heated case are found to agree reasonably well with laboratory, field, and large-eddy simulation results, when Deardorff's mixed-layer scaling is used. No indication of large-scale longitudinal roll cells is found in this convection-dominated flow, for which the inversion height to Obukhov length scale ratio - z i / L , = 26. However, when heating is more moderate (so that - z i / L , = 2), evidence of coherent rolls is present. About 10\% of the total turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent heat flux, and 20\% of the Reynolds shear stress, are estimated to be a direct consequence of the observed cells.},

The CBL is forced by a constant buoyancy ﬂux and grows into a ﬂuid with a constant buoyancy gradient N2 ≥ 0. We study the dependence on N2 of the vertical proﬁles of the mean and the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) of the buoyancy. We ﬁnd that, although the mean buoyancy proﬁle varies with height as b ∝ z−1/3 accordingly to the classical similarity theory, the r.m.s. deviates from that theory and varies as brms ∝ z−0.45. It is also found that, despite differences in the large-scale circulations induced by different values of N2, these vertical proﬁles tend to become independent of N2 near the wall. However, the depth of over which the previous scaling laws are observed increases with N2. Spectral analysis shows that, correspondingly, the nearwall structure becomes increasingly similar among cases as the scale separation between the CBL depth and the surface scale increases.},

	abstract = {A cloud parametrization scheme which allows for low, medium, high and convective clouds has been developed from GATE data for use in the Meteorological Office 11-layer tropical model. The problems involved in using synoptic observations to derive methods of predicting clouds are discussed. Only limited success was obtained in relating observed cloud amounts to relative humidity and atmospheric temperature structure. The restrictions imposed on the cloud scheme by the model's resolution and by its inability to produce a perfect simulation are considered. In the light of these difficulties a simple approach was adopted based on the assumption that condensation on the smallest scales is part of a larger-scale condensation regime related to the synoptic scale situation. The scheme has been designed to reproduce the main features of a cloud field by relating the large-scale meteorological features associated with a cloud distribution to model variables. Low, medium and high cloud amounts are determined from a quadratic relationship with relative humidity. Low cloud has also been related to the temperature lapse rate in an attempt to model the persistent areas of sub-tropical stratocumulus occurring under inversions. A relative humidity relationship is inappropriate for convective cloud which has, therefore, been related to the convective mass flux calculated in the convection scheme of the model. The scheme has been reasonably successful in predicting the cloudiness associated with the ITCZ and the NE. and SE. trades. The cloud fields showed a good degree of coherence from day to day and there were no signs of unrealistic feedbacks between radiation, cloud and dynamics.},

These simulations are motivated by the ubiquity of such multiscale superpositions throughout the atmosphere. Three simulations explore the effects of linear ﬁne structure alignment along, orthogonal to, and at 458 to the plane of GW propagation. These reveal that ﬁne structure alignment with the GW enables strong wave–wave interactions, strong deformations of the initial ﬂow components, and rapid transitions to local instabilities and turbulence. Increasing departures of ﬁne structure alignment from the GW yield increasingly less efﬁcient wave–wave interactions and weaker or absent local instabilities. The simulation having rotary ﬁne structure velocities yields wave–wave interactions that agree closely with the aligned linear ﬁne structure case. Differences in the aligned GW ﬁelds are only seen following the onset of local instabilities, which are delayed by about 1–2 buoyancy periods for rotary ﬁne structure compared to aligned, linear ﬁne structure. In all cases, local instabilities and turbulence primarily accompany strong superposed shears or ﬂuid ‘‘intrusions’’ within the rising, and least statically stable, phase of the GW. For rotary ﬁne structure, local instabilities having preferred streamwise or spanwise orientations often arise independently, depending on the character of the larger-scale ﬂow. Wave–wave interactions play the greatest role in reducing the initial GW amplitude whereas ﬁne structure shears and intrusions are the major source of instability and turbulence energies.},

That study and this companion paper were motivated by the ubiquity of multiscale GW–FS superpositions throughout the atmosphere. These DNSs exhibit combinations of wave–wave interactions and local instabilities that depart significantly from those accompanying idealized GWs or mean flows alone, surprising dependence of the flow evolution on the details of the FS, and an interesting additional pathway to instability and turbulence due to GW–FS superpositions. This paper examines the mechanical and thermal energy dissipation rates occurring in two of these DNSs. Findings include 1) dissipation that tends to be much more localized and variable than that due to GW instability in the absence of FS, 2) dissipation statistics indicative of multiple turbulence sources, 3) strong influences of FS shears on instability occurrence and turbulence intensities and statistics, and 4) significant differences between mechanical and thermal dissipation rate fields having potentially important implications for measurements of these flows.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The Ekman boundary layer is in a transitionally rough regime and, without stratification, the effect of roughness is found to be mild in contrast to the stratified case. Roughness, whose effect increases with the slope of the bumps, changes the boundary layer qualitatively from the very stable (Mahrt,

The flat case exhibits initial collapse of turbulence which eventually recovers, albeit with inertial oscillations in turbulent kinetic energy. The roughness elements interrupt the initial collapse of turbulence. In the quasi-steady state, the thickness of the turbulent stress profiles and of the near-surface region with subcritical gradient Richardson number increase in the rough cases. Analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget shows that, in the surface layer, roughness counteracts the stability-induced reduction of TKE production. The flow component, coherent with the surface undulations, is extracted by a triple decomposition, and leads to a dispersive component of near-surface turbulent fluxes. The significance of the dispersive component increases in the stratified cases.},

The formation of these SHIs is usually associated with large-scale advection of humid air masses. However, the potential coupling of SHIs with cloud layers by turbulent processes is not fully understood. In this study, we analyze a 3 d period of a persistent layer of increased specific humidity above a stratocumulus cloud observed during an Arctic field campaign in June 2017. The tethered balloon system BELUGA (Balloon-bornE moduLar Utility for profilinG the lower Atmosphere) recorded vertical profile data of meteorological, turbulence, and radiation parameters in the atmospheric boundary layer. An in-depth discussion of the problems associated with humidity measurements in cloudy environments leads to the conclusion that the observed SHIs do not result from measurement artifacts. We analyze two different scenarios for the SHI in relation to the cloud top capped by a temperature inversion: (i) the SHI coincides with the cloud top, and (ii) the SHI is vertically separated from the lowered cloud top. In the first case, the SHI and the cloud layer are coupled by turbulence that extends over the cloud top and connects the two layers by turbulent mixing. Several profiles reveal downward virtual sensible and latent heat fluxes at the cloud top, indicating entrainment of humid air supplied by the SHI into the cloud layer. For the second case, a downward moisture transport at the base of the SHI and an upward moisture flux at the cloud top is observed. Therefore, the area between the cloud top and SHI is supplied with moisture from both sides. Finally, large-eddy simulations (LESs) complement the observations by modeling a case of the first scenario. The simulations reproduce the observed downward turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture at the cloud top. The LES realizations suggest that in the presence of a SHI, the cloud layer remains thicker and the temperature inversion height is elevated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The structure of the radiatively dominated stable boundary layer is analysed using idealized calculations at high vertical and spectral resolution. The temperature proﬁle of a nocturnal radiative boundary layer, developing after the evening transition, is found to be well described in terms of radiative cooling to the surface, although radiative exchanges within the atmosphere become increasingly important with time. The treatment of non-black surfaces is discussed in some detail and it is shown that the effect of reducing the surface emissivity is to decrease rather than to increase the radiative cooling rate in the surface layer. It is also argued that an accurate assessment of the impact of non-black surfaces requires careful attention to the spectral and directional characteristics of the surface emissivity. A polar nocturnal boundary layer, developing above snow-covered ground, is simulated and found to reach a slowly evolving state characterized by a strong radiative divergence near the surface that is comparable to observed values. Radiative boundary layers are characterized by large temperature gradients near the surface.},

The model, which is a slight generalization of the cloud-topped, mixed-layer model of Lilly (1968), has as dependent variables the cloud-top height, cloud-base height, mixed-layer moist static energy and total water content, the turbulent fluxes of moist static energy and total water, the cloud-top jumps of moist static energy and total water, the cloud-top temperature, and the net radiative flux divergence at cloud top and in the mixed layer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Under horizontally homogeneous steady-state conditions the governing equations reduce to a system of algebraic equations which is easily solved. This system has been solved for sea surface temperatures between 13 and 18°C and large-scale divergences between 1×10$^{\textrm{−6}}$ and 6×10$^{\textrm{−6}}$ s$^{\textrm{−1}}$. These calculations have been performed for the case when all the radiative cooling is confined to the cloud-top jump condition and for the case when some of the cooling is allowed to extend into the mixed layer. The results show that the general pattern of mixed-layer response to sea surface temperature and large-scale divergence is not highly sensitive to the radiation partition. The results also show that the thermodynamic properties of the mixed layer and the surface fluxes of moist static energy and water vapor are sensitive to sea surface temperature but not to large-scale divergence. However, the mixed-layer depth is sensitive to large-scale divergence. Roughly speaking, the depth is inversely proportional to divergence so that halving the divergence approximately doubles the depth of the layer, which means that the cloud top seeks a certain subsidence (entrainment) rate. The turbulent fluxes of heat, water vapor and liquid water are discontinuous at cloud base. These discontinuities are interpreted in terms of convective parcel paths.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
