The Reynolds numbers based on the friction velocity and the channel half width are 180, 395, 640 and 1020, and the molecular Prandtl numbers are 0.025 and 0.71. A local peak for Pr {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0:71 and large peaks for Pr {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0:025 appear in the spanwise-wavenumber power spectra at low wavenumbers, and these peaks become more significant with increasing Reynolds number. This suggests that the effect of large-scale structures extends even to the surface heat-flux fluctuations, and increases with increasing Reynolds number. In addition, it was found that the surface heat-flux fluctuations for Pr {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0:71 are mostly similar to the streamwise wall shear-stress fluctuations, while a noticeable dissimilarity can be seen in the large positive and negative fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Intermittent breakdowns that accompany wind gusts at the surface are responsible for a large fraction of the turbulent exchange between the surface and the upper boundary layer in the core of clear nights. Vertical and horizontal structure of the breakdowns are investigated using data from a network of 26 stations in an area of 30 km {\texttimes} 30 km. Surface heterogeneity in the area includes complex terrain with different types of land cover. We treat the fine-scale landscape structure near sensors (`sheltering') as a separate component of heterogeneity. These features have important consequences on the spatial distribution of mean variables and surface fluxes. We found that breakdowns connect the surface layer to a higher level (level HC ). Weak wind gusts below a threshold (approximately 1.5 m s-1) mix the air down to the colder ground, cooling the surface layer. On the other hand, wind gusts above this threshold promote mixing with upper levels, warming the surface layer. The spatial maximum of surface temperature over the network can be used as an estimate of the temperature at HC , allowing vertical gradients and stability to be approximated. Minimum temperature is a function of topography and sheltering. Appreciable surface fluxes at night occur primarily at high, open locations, and can be large enough there to influence area-averaged values. Surface-flux parameterizations currently used in mesoscale models were tested first by estimating fluxes at each station and aggregating, and then by forming area-averages before estimating fluxes. Results show that these formulations underestimate the average surface fluxes over a region for most of the nights.},

  abstract = {Intermittent transitions between turbulent and nonturbulent states are ubiquitous in the stable atmospheric surface layer (ASL). Data from two field experiments in Utqia{\.g}vik, Alaska, and from direct numerical simulations are used to probe these state transitions so as to (i) identify statistical metrics for the detection of intermittency, (ii) probe the physical origin of turbulent bursts, and (iii) quantify intermittency effects on overall fluxes and their representation in closure models. The analyses reveal three turbulence regimes, two of which correspond to weakly turbulent periods accompanied by intermittent behavior (regime 1: intermittent; regime 2: transitional), while the third is associated with a fully turbulent flow. Based on time series of the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), two nondimensional parameters are proposed to diagnostically categorize the ASL state into these regimes; the first characterizes the weakest turbulence state, while the second describes the range of turbulence variability. The origins of intermittent turbulence activity are then investigated based on the TKE budget over the identified bursts. While the quantitative results depend on the height, the analyses indicate that these bursts are predominantly advected by the mean flow, produced locally by mechanical shear, or lofted from lower levels by turbulent ejections. Finally, a new flux model is proposed using the vertical velocity variance in combination with different mixing length scales. The model provides improved representation (correlation coefficients with observations of 0.61 for sensible heat and 0.94 for momentum) compared to Monin-Obukhov similarity (correlation coefficients of 0.0047 for sensible heat and 0.49 for momentum), thus opening new pathways for improved parameterizations in coarse atmospheric models.},

  abstract = {Abstract Intermittent transitions between turbulent and nonturbulent states are ubiquitous in the stable atmospheric surface layer (ASL). Data from two field experiments in Utqia{\.g}vik, Alaska, and from direct numerical simulations are used to probe these state transitions so as to (i) identify statistical metrics for the detection of intermittency, (ii) probe the physical origin of turbulent bursts, and (iii) quantify intermittency effects on overall fluxes and their representation in closure models. The analyses reveal three turbulence regimes, two of which correspond to weakly turbulent periods accompanied by intermittent behavior (regime 1: intermittent; regime 2: transitional), while the third is associated with a fully turbulent flow. Based on time series of the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), two nondimensional parameters are proposed to diagnostically categorize the ASL state into these regimes; the first characterizes the weakest turbulence state, while the second describes the range of turbulence variability. The origins of intermittent turbulence activity are then investigated based on the TKE budget over the identified bursts. While the quantitative results depend on the height, the analyses indicate that these bursts are predominantly advected by the mean flow, produced locally by mechanical shear, or lofted from lower levels by turbulent ejections. Finally, a new flux model is proposed using the vertical velocity variance in combination with different mixing length scales. The model provides improved representation (correlation coefficients with observations of 0.61 for sensible heat and 0.94 for momentum) compared to Monin--Obukhov similarity (correlation coefficients of 0.0047 for sensible heat and 0.49 for momentum), thus opening new pathways for improved parameterizations in coarse atmospheric models. Significance Statement Airflow in the lowest layer of the atmosphere is often modulated by a strong gradient of temperature when the surface is much cooler than the air. Such a regime results in weak turbulence and mixing, and is ubiquitous during nighttime and in polar regions. Understanding and modeling atmospheric flow and turbulence under such conditions are further complicated by ``turbulence intermittency,'' which manifests as periods of strong turbulent activity interspersed in a more quiescent airflow. The turbulent periods dominate the air--surface exchanges even when they occur over a small fraction of the time. This paper develops approaches to detect and classify such intermittent regimes, examines how the turbulent bursts are generated and advected, and offers guidance on representing such regimes in geophysical models. The findings have the potential to advance weather forecasting and climate modeling, particularly in the all-important polar regions.},

  abstract = {We employ a coarse-graining approach to analyze nonlinear cascades in Boussinesq flows using high-resolution simulation data. We derive budgets which resolve the evolution of energy and potential enstrophy simultaneously in space and in scale. We then use numerical simulations of Boussinesq flows, with forcing in the large-scales, and fixed rotation and stable stratification along the vertical axis, to study the inter-scale flux of energy and potential enstrophy in three different regimes of stratification and rotation: (i) strong rotation and moderate stratification, (ii) moderate rotation and strong stratification, and (iii) equally strong stratification and rotation. In all three cases, we observe constant fluxes of both global invariants, the mean energy and mean potential enstrophy, from large to small scales. The existence of constant potential enstrophy flux ranges provides the first direct empirical evidence in support of the notion of a cascade of potential enstrophy. The persistent forward cascade of the two invariants reflects a marked departure of these flows from two-dimensional turbulence.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the relevance of accurate surface parameters, in particular soil moisture, and of parameterizations for heterogeneous land surfaces, for the prediction of sensible and latent heat fluxes by a mesoscale weather forecast model with horizontal grid resolution of 7 km. The analysis is based on model integrations for a 30-day period, which are compared both to flux measurements obtained from the LITFASS-2003 field experiment and to high-resolution-model (1-km grid spacing) results. At first, the relevance of improved parameter sets and input data compared to usual operational practice for an accurate prediction of near-surface fluxes is shown and discussed. It is demonstrated that an observation-based land-surface assimilation scheme leads to an improved soil moisture analysis, which is shown to be essential for the realistic simulation of surface fluxes. Secondly, the implementation of two efficient parameterization strategies for subgrid-scale variability of the surface, the mosaic and the tile approach, is presented. Using these methods, the simulations are in better agreement with measurements than simulations with simple aggregation methods that use effective surface parameters. Integrations with the mosaic approach reproduce high resolution simulations very well and more accurately than simulations with the tile method. Finally, the high resolution simulations are analyzed to justify and discuss the approximations underlying both methods.},

The resolution was chosen to be coarse so that the results might be sensitive to the details of the various subgrid scale model formulations. Stochastic backscatter of subgrid kinetic energy and scalar variance was included in one subgrid scale model. Profiles of first and second moments, budgets of resolved-scale second moments, and spectra have been analyzed.

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulation of the turbulent Ekman layer over a smooth wall is used to investigate bulk properties of a planetary boundary layer under stable stratification. Our simplified configuration depends on two non-dimensional parameters: a Richardson number characterizing the stratification and a Reynolds number characterizing the turbulence scale separation. This simplified configuration is sufficient to reproduce global intermittency, a turbulence collapse, and the decoupling of the surface from the outer region of the boundary layer. Global intermittency appears even in the absence of local perturbations at the surface; the only requirement is that large-scale structures several times wider than the boundary-layer height have enough space to develop. Analysis of the mean velocity, turbulence kinetic energy, and external intermittency is used to investigate the large-scale structures and corresponding differences between stably stratified Ekman flow and channel flow. Both configurations show a similar transition to the turbulence collapse, overshoot of turbulence kinetic energy, and spectral properties. Differences in the outer region resulting from the rotation of the system lead, however, to the generation of enstrophy in the non-turbulent patches of the Ekman flow. The coefficient of the stability correction function from Monin--Obukhov similarity theory is estimated as {$\beta$} {$\approx$} 5.7 in agreement with atmospheric observations, theoretical considerations, and results from stably stratified channel flows. Our results demonstrate the applicability of this set-up to atmospheric problems despite the intermediate Reynolds number achieved in our simulations.},

  abstract = {Existence of non-turbulent flow patches in the vicinity of the wall of a turbulent flow is known as global intermittency. Global intermittency challenges the conventional statistics approach when describing turbulence in the inner layer and calls for the use of conditional statistics. We extend the vorticity-based conditioning of a flow to turbulent and non-turbulent sub-volumes by a high-pass filter operation. This modified method consistently detects non-turbulent flow patches in the outer and inner layers for stratifications ranging from the neutral limit to extreme stability, where the flow is close to a complete laminarization. When applying this conditioning method to direct numerical simulation data of stably stratified Ekman flow, we find the following. First, external intermittency has a strong effect on the logarithmic law for the mean velocity in Ekman flow under neutral stratification. If instead of the full field, only turbulent sub-volumes are considered, the data fit an idealized logarithmic velocity profile much better; in particular, a problematic dip in the von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n measure {$\kappa$} in the surface layer is decreased by approximately 50 \% and our data only support the reduced range 0.41 {$\kappa$} 0.43. Second, order-one changes in turbulent quantities under strong stratification can be explained by a modulation of the turbulent volume fraction rather than by a structural change of individual turbulence events; within the turbulent fraction of the flow, the character of individual turbulence events measured in terms of turbulence dissipation rate or variance of velocity fluctuations is similar to that under neutral stratification.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) experiments have been performed using the Parallelized LES Model (PALM). A methodology for validating and understanding LES results for plume dispersion and concentration fluctuations in an atmospheric-like flow is presented. A wide range of grid resolutions is shown to be necessary for investigating the convergence of statistical characteristics of velocity and scalar fields. For the scalar, the statistical moments up to the fourth order and the shape of the concentration probability density function (p.d.f.) are examined. The mean concentration is influenced by grid resolution, with the highest resolution simulation showing a lower mean concentration, linked to larger turbulent structures. However, a clear tendency to convergence of the concentration variance is observed at the two higher resolutions. This behaviour is explained by showing that the mechanisms driving the mean and the variance are differently influenced by the grid resolution. The analysis of skewness and kurtosis allows also the obtaining of general results on plume concentration fluctuations. Irrespective of grid resolution, a family of Gamma p.d.f.s well represents the shape of the concentration p.d.f. but only beyond the peak of the concentration fluctuation intensity. In the early plume dispersion phases, the moments of the p.d.f. are in good agreement with those generated by a fluctuating plume model. To the best of our knowledge, our study demonstrates for the first time that, if resolution and averaging time are adequate, atmospheric LES provides a trustworthy representation of the high order moments of the concentration field, up to the fourth order, for a dispersing plume.},

  abstract = {Boundary-forced stratified turbulence is studied in the prototypical case of turbulent  channel flow subject to stable stratification. The large-eddy simulation approach is  used with a mixed subgrid model that involves a dynamic eddy viscosity component  and a scale-similarity component. After an initial transient, the flow reaches a new  balanced state corresponding to active wall-bounded turbulence with reduced vertical  transport which, for the cases in our study with moderate-to-large levels of stratification,  coexists with internal wave activity in the core of the channel. A systematic  reduction of turbulence levels, density fluctuations and associated vertical transport  with increasing stratification is observed. Countergradient buoyancy flux is observed  in the outer region for sufficiently high stratification.             Mixing of the density field in stratified channel flow results from turbulent events  generated near the boundaries that couple with the outer, more stable flow. The  vertical density structure is thus of interest for analogous boundary-forced mixing  situations in geophysical flows. It is found that, with increasing stratification, the  mean density profile becomes sharper in the central region between the two turbulent  layers at the upper and lower walls, similar to observations in field measurements as  well as laboratory experiments with analogous density-mixing situations.                            Channel flow is strongly inhomogeneous with alternative choices for the Richardson  number. In spite of these complications, the gradient Richardson number,               Ri                                g                              , appears  to be the important local determinant of buoyancy effects. All simulated cases show  that correlation coefficients associated with vertical transport collapse from their nominal unstratified  values over a narrow range, 0.15 {$<$}               Ri                                g                              {$<$} 0.25. The vertical turbulent  Froude number,               Fr                                w                              , has an               O               (1) value across most of the channel. It  is remarkable that stratified channel flow, with such a large variation of overall  density difference (factor of 26) between cases, shows a relatively universal behaviour  of correlation coefficients and vertical Froude number when plotted as a function of               Ri                                g                              . The visualizations show wavy motion in the core region where the gradient  Richardson number,               Ri                                g                              , is large and low-speed streaks in the near-wall region,  typical of unstratified channel flow, where               Ri                                g                              is small. It appears from the  visualizations that, with increasing stratification, the region with wavy motion progressively encroaches  into the zone with active turbulence; the location of               Ri                                g                              {$\simeq$} 0.2 roughly  corresponds to the boundary between the two zones.},

  abstract = {The diurnal and seasonal variations of the northern Australian dryline are examined by constructing climatologies of low-level dynamic and thermodynamic variables taken from the high-resolution Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Limited Area Prediction Scheme (LAPS) forecasts from 2000 to 2003. The development of the dryline is analyzed within the framework of the frontogenesis function applied to the mixing ratio and the airstream diagnostics of Cohen and Schultz. A case study of 12--13 October 2002 illustrating the airmass boundaries over the Australian region is also examined. Daytime surface heating produces sea-breeze circulations around the coast and a large inland heat trough that extends east--west along northern Australia. At night, air parcels accelerate toward low pressure, increasing convergence and deformation within the heat trough. This sharpens the moisture gradient across the tropical and continental airmass boundary into a dryline. This is different than the dryline of the Great Plains in the United States, which generally weakens overnight. The Australian dryline is strongest in spring just poleward of the Gulf of Carpentaria, where the moisture gradient across the heat trough is enhanced by the coast, and the axis of dilatation is closely aligned with mixing ratio isopleths. The dryline is weakest in winter, when the heat trough is weak. The LAPS 3-h forecasts are in good agreement with observations obtained from the Automatic Weather Station network. The 3-h forecasts capture the observed diurnal and seasonal cycle of the airmass boundaries. However, the sea-breeze circulation and ageostrophic flow into the surface heat trough is limited by the model resolution. The LAPS 3-h forecasts may therefore underestimate the nocturnal intensification of the dryline, especially since the inland moisture content is overestimated.},

  abstract = {In wall-bounded turbulence, a multitude of coexisting turbulence structures form the streamwise velocity energy spectrum from the viscosity- to the inertia-dominated range of scales. Definite scaling-trends for streamwise spectra have remained empirically elusive, although a prominent school of thought stems from the works of Perry \& Abell (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 79, 1977, pp. 785--799) and Perry et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 165, 1986, pp. 163--199), which were greatly inspired by the attached-eddy hypothesis of Townsend (The Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow, Cambridge University Press, 1976). In this paper, we re-examine the turbulence kinetic energy of the streamwise velocity component in the context of the spectral decompositions of Perry and co-workers. Two universal spectral filters are derived via spectral coherence analysis of two-point velocity signals, spanning a Reynolds-number range Re{$\tau$} {$\sim$} O(103) to O(106) and form the basis for our decomposition of the logarithmic-region turbulence into stochastically wall-detached and wall-attached portions of energy. The latter is composed of scales larger than a streamwise/wall-normal ratio of {$\lambda$}x/z {$\approx$} 14. If the decomposition is accepted, a kx-1 scaling region can only appear for Re{$\tau$} 80 000, at a wall-normal position of z+ = 100. Following Perry and co-workers, it is hypothesized that spectral contributions from turbulence structures other than attached eddies obscure a kx-1 scaling. When accepting the idea of different spectral contributions it is furthermore shown that a broad outer-spectral peak is present even at low Re{$\tau$} .},

Since sub-components of the streamwise turbulence intensity u2 follow from an integration of the velocity energy spectra, we here focus on the scaling of the former. Wall-normal profiles and Reynolds-number trends of the three individual, additive sub-components of the streamwise turbulence intensity are examined. Based on universal trends across all Reynolds numbers considered, some evidence is given for a Townsend--Perry constant of A1 = 0.98, which would describe the wall-normal logarithmic decay of the turbulence intensity per Townsend's attached-eddy hypothesis. It is also demonstrated how this constant can be consistent with the Reynolds-number increase of the streamwise turbulence intensity in the near-wall region.},

  abstract = {The performance of an atmospheric single-column model (SCM) is studied systematically for stably-stratified conditions. To this end, 11 years (2005--2015) of daily SCM simulations were compared to observations from the Cabauw observatory, The Netherlands. Each individual clear-sky night was classified in terms of the ambient geostrophic wind speed with a 1 m s-1 bin-width. Nights with overcast conditions were filtered out by selecting only those nights with an average net radiation of less than - 30 W m-2. A similar procedure was applied to the observational dataset. A comparison of observed and modelled ensembleaveraged profiles of wind speed and potential temperature and time series of turbulent fluxes showed that the model represents the dynamics of the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) at Cabauw very well for a broad range of mechanical forcing conditions. No obvious difference in model performance was found between near-neutral and strongly-stratified conditions. Furthermore, observed NBL regime transitions are represented in a natural way. The reference model version performs much better than a model version that applies excessive vertical mixing as is done in several (global) operational models. Model sensitivity runs showed that for weak-wind conditions the inversion strength depends much more on details of the landatmosphere coupling than on the turbulent mixing. The presented results indicate that in principle the physical parametrizations of large-scale atmospheric models are sufficiently equipped for modelling stably-stratified conditions for a wide range of forcing conditions.},

It is generally found that scatter in the dimensionless lapse rate ␾h is larger than in the dimensionless shear ␾m when plotted versus the stability parameter z/⌳ (where ⌳ is the local Obukhov length). Here, this phenomenon is explained to be a result of self-correlation due to the occurrence of the momentum and the heat flux on both axes, measurement uncertainties, and other possibly relevant physical processes left aside. It is shown that the ratio between relative errors in the turbulent fluxes influences the orientation of self-correlation in the flux--gradient relationships. In stable conditions, the scatter in ␾m is largely suppressed by self-correlation while for ␾h this is not the case (vice versa for unstable stratification). An alternative way of plotting is discussed for determining the slope of the linear ␾m function.},

The pressure is therefore determined to within a function proportional to the basestate density field with arbitrary amplitude. This ambiguity is removed by requiring that the total mass be conserved in the model. This approach enables one to determine the correct temperature field that is required for the microphysical calculations. This correct, mass-conserving anelastic model predicts a temperature field that is an accurate approximation to that of a compressible atmosphere that has undergone a hydrostatic adjustment in response to a horizontally homogeneous heating or moistening. The procedure is demonstrated analytically and numerically for a one-dimensional, idealized heat source and moisture sink associated with moist convection. Two-dimensional anelastic simulations compare the effect of the new formulation on the evolution of the flow fields in a simulation of the ascent of a warm bubble in a conditionally unstable model atmosphere.},

Here in Part 1, a scaling law (incomplete similarity with respect to local Reynolds number based on distance from the wall) is proposed for the mean velocity distribution in developed turbulent shear flow. The proposed scaling law involves a special dependence of the power exponent and multiplicative factor on the flow Reynolds number. It emerges that the universal logarithmic law is closely related to the envelope of a family of power-type curves, each corresponding to a fixed Reynolds number. A skin-friction law, corresponding to the proposed scaling law for the mean velocity distribution, is derived.

Meanwhile, some incompleteness of the experimental data presented in the work of Nikuradze (1932) is noticed, namely the lack of data in the range of parameters where the difference between scaling law and universal logarithmic law predictions should be the largest.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Urban boundary layers (UBLs) can be highly complex due to the heterogeneous roughness and heating of the surface, particularly at night. Due to a general lack of observations, it is not clear whether canonical models of boundary layer mixing are appropriate in modelling air quality in urban areas. This paper reports Doppler lidar observations of turbulence profiles in the centre of London, UK, as part of the second REPARTEE campaign in autumn 2007. Lidar-measured standard deviation of vertical velocity averaged over 30 min intervals generally compared well with in situ sonic anemometer measurements at 190 m on the BT telecommunications Tower. During calm, nocturnal periods, the lidar underestimated turbulent mixing due mainly to limited sampling rate. Mixing height derived from the turbulence, and aerosol layer height from the backscatter profiles, showed similar diurnal cycles ranging from c. 300 to 800 m, increasing to c. 200 to 850 m under clear skies. The aerosol layer height was sometimes significantly different to the mixing height, particularly at night under clear skies. For convective and neutral cases, the scaled turbulence profiles resembled canonical results; this was less clear for the stable case. Lidar observations clearly showed enhanced mixing beneath stratocumulus clouds reaching down on occasion to approximately half daytime boundary layer depth. On one occasion the nocturnal turbulent structure was consistent with a nocturnal jet, suggesting a stable layer. Given the general agreement between observations and canonical turbulence profiles, mixing timescales were calculated for passive scalars released at street level to reach the BT Tower using existing models of turbulent mixing. It was estimated to take c. 10 min to diffuse up to 190 m, rising to between 20 and 50 min at night, depending on stability. Determination of mixing timescales is important when comparing to physico-chemical processes acting on pollutant species measured simultaneously at both the ground and at the BT Tower during the campaign. From the 3 week autumnal data-set there is evidence for occasional stable layers in central London, effectively decoupling surface emissions from air aloft.},

We use an objective detection technique based on wavelet transforms. The applied technique permits the isolation of the coherent structures from small-scale background fluctuations which is necessary for the development of dynamical models describing the evolution and properties of these phenomena. It was observed that coherent structures occupied 36\% of the total time with mean turbulent flux contributions of 44\% for momentum and 48\% for heat. The calculation of a transport efficiency parameter indicates that coherent structures transport heat more efficiently than momentum. Furthermore, the transport efficiency increases with increasing contribution of the structures to the overall transport.},

A moderately stable case is used, based on Arctic observations. All models produce successful simulations, in as much as they generate resolved turbulence and reflect many of the results from local scaling theory and observations. Simulations performed at 1-m and 2-m resolution show only small changes in the mean profiles compared to coarser resolutions. Also, sensitivity to subgrid models for individual models highlights their importance in SBL simulation at moderate resolution (6.25 m). Stability functions are derived from the LES using typical mixing lengths used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models. The functions have smaller values than those used in NWP. There is also support for the use of K-profile similarity in parametrizations. Thus, the results provide improved understanding and motivate future developments of the parametrization of the SBL.},

Both studies yielded a high correlation between the available slant delays at higher elevation angles but showed deficiencies at low elevations. The mean bias between the GPS zenith delays and the radiometer data is 1.18 mm with a RMS of 6.0 mm. The corresponding bias and RMS of the GPS vs. model comparison are 3.3 mm and 2.9 mm.},

  abstract = {A theory is derived for the class of long two-dimensional waves, comprising solitary and periodic cnoidal waves, that can propagate with unchanging form in heterogeneous fluids. The treatment is generalized to the extent that the waves are supposed to arise on a horizontal stream of incompressible fluid whose density and velocity are arbitrary functions of height, and the upper surface of the fluid is allowed either to be free or to be fixed in a horizontal plane. Explicit formulae for the wave properties and a general interpretation of the physical conditions for the occurrence of the waves are achieved without need to specify particular physical models; but in a later part of the paper, {\S}4, the results are applied to three examples that have been worked out by other means and so provide checks on the present theory. These general results are also shown to accord nicely with the principle of `conjugate-flow pairs' which was explained by Benjamin (1962               b               ) with reference to swirling flows along cylindrical ducts, but which is known to apply equally well to flow systems of the kind in question here.                          The theory reveals certain physical peculiarities of a type of flow model often used in theoretical studies of internal-wave phenomena, being specified so as to make the equation for the stream-function linear. In an appendix, some observations are also made regarding the `Boussinesq approximation', which too is often used as a simplifying assumption in this field. It is shown, adding to a recent discussion by Long (1965), that finite internal waves may depend crucially on small effects neglected in this approximation.},

  abstract = {Abstract The last decade has seen the success of stochastic parameterizations in short-term, medium-range, and seasonal forecasts: operational weather centers now routinely use stochastic parameterization schemes to represent model inadequacy better and to improve the quantification of forecast uncertainty. Developed initially for numerical weather prediction, the inclusion of stochastic parameterizations not only provides better estimates of uncertainty, but it is also extremely promising for reducing long-standing climate biases and is relevant for determining the climate response to external forcing. This article highlights recent developments from different research groups that show that the stochastic representation of unresolved processes in the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and cryosphere of comprehensive weather and climate models 1) gives rise to more reliable probabilistic forecasts of weather and climate and 2) reduces systematic model bias. We make a case that the use of mathematically stringent methods for the derivation of stochastic dynamic equations will lead to substantial improvements in our ability to accurately simulate weather and climate at all scales. Recent work in mathematics, statistical mechanics, and turbulence is reviewed; its relevance for the climate problem is demonstrated; and future research directions are outlined.},

For dense matrices, we present those schemes that yield the complete decomposition, whereas for sparse matrices we describe schemes that yield only the extremal singular triplets. Special attention is devoted to the computation of the smallest singular values which are normally the most difficult to evaluate but which provide a measure of the distance to singularity of the matrix under consideration. Also, we conclude with the presentation of a parallel method for computing pseudospectra, which depends on computing the smallest singular values.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulation of turbulent incompressible plane-channel flow between a smooth wall and one covered with regular three-dimensional roughness elements is performed. While the impact of roughness on the mean-velocity profile of turbulent wall layers is well understood, at least qualitatively, the manner in which other features are affected, especially in the outer layer, has been more controversial. We compare results from the smooth- and rough-wall sides of the channel for three different roughness heights of h+ = 5.4, 10.8, and 21.6 for Re{$\tau$} of 400, to isolate the effects of the roughness on turbulent statistics and the instantaneous turbulence structure at large and small scales. We focus on the interaction between the near-wall and outer-layer regions, in particular the extent to which the near-wall behavior influences the flow further away from the surface. Roughness tends to increase the intensity of the velocity and vorticity fluctuations in the inner layer. In the outer layer, although the roughness alters the velocity fluctuations, the vorticity fluctuations are relatively unaffected. The higher-order moments and the energy budgets demonstrate significant differences between the smooth-wall and rough-wall sides in the processes associated with the wall-normal fluxes of the Reynolds shear stresses and turbulence kinetic energy. The length scales and flow dynamics in the roughness sublayer, the spatially inhomogeneous layer within which the flow is directly influenced by the individual roughness elements, are also examined. Alternative mechanisms involved in producing and maintaining near-wall turbulence in rough-wall boundary layers are also considered. We find that the strength of the inner/outer-layer interactions are greatly affected by the size of the roughness elements.},

This is investigated using observations collected from October to November of 2018 during the Stable Atmospheric Variability ANd Transport (SAVANT) field campaign conducted in a shallow sloping Midwestern field. We analyze the turbulence velocity scale and its variation with the mean wind speed using observations up to 10--20~m on four meteorological towers located along a shallow gully. The roughness length for momentum over this complex terrain varied with wind direction from 0.0049~m to a maximum of 0.12~m for winds coming through deciduous trees present in the field. The variation of the turbulence velocity with wind speed shows a transition from a weak wind regime to a stronger wind regime, as reported by past studies. This transition is not observed for winds coming from the tree area, where turbulence is enhanced even for weak wind speeds. For weak stratification and stronger winds, the turbulent velocity scale increased with an increase in roughness while the terrain slope is seen to have a weak influence. The sizes of the dominant turbulent eddies seen from the vertical velocity power spectra are observed to be larger for winds coming through the tree area. The turbulence enhancement by the trees is found to be strong within a fetch distance of 7 times the tree height and not observable at 16 times of the tree height.},

  abstract = {The velocity fields of a turbulent wake behind a flat plate obtained from the direct  numerical simulations of Moser               et al.               (1998) are used to study the structure of the  flow in the intermittent zone where there are, alternately, regions of fully turbulent  flow and non-turbulent velocity fluctuations on either side of a thin randomly moving  interface. Comparisons are made with a wake that is `forced' by amplifying initial  velocity fluctuations. A temperature field               T               , with constant values of 1.0 and 0 above  and below the wake, is transported across the wake as a passive scalar. The value of  the Reynolds number based on the centreplane mean velocity defect and half-width               b               of the wake is               Re               {$\approx$} 2000.                                         The thickness of the continuous interface is about 0.07               b               , whereas the amplitude of  fluctuations of the instantaneous interface displacement               y                                I                              (               t               ) is an order of magnitude  larger, being about 0.5               b               . This explains why the mean statistics of vorticity in the  intermittent zone can be calculated in terms of the probability distribution of               y                                I                              and the instantaneous discontinuity in vorticity across the interface. When plotted as  functions of               y               -               y                                I                              the conditional mean velocity {\textlangle}               U               {\textrangle} and temperature {\textlangle}               T               {\textrangle} profiles  show sharp jumps at the interface adjacent to a thick zone where {\textlangle}               U               {\textrangle} and {\textlangle}               T               {\textrangle} vary  much more slowly.                          Statistics for the conditional vorticity and velocity variances, available in such detail  only from DNS data, show how streamwise and spanwise components of vorticity are  generated by vortex stretching in the bulges of the interface. While mean Reynolds  stresses (in the fixed reference frame) decrease gradually in the intermittent zone,  conditional stresses are roughly constant and then decrease sharply towards zero  at the interface. Flow fields around the interface, analysed in terms of the local  streamline pattern, confirm and explain previous results that the advancement of the  vortical interface into the irrotational flow is driven by large-scale eddy motion.             Terms used in one-point turbulence models are evaluated both conventionally and  conditionally in the interface region, and the current practice in statistical models of  approximating entrainment by a diffusion process is assessed.},

  abstract = {Abstract SYNOPSIS The squall and steering lines of cyclones constitute, when considered together, a line of discontinuity north of which the air is characterized by low temperature, high visibility, dryness, and motion from east and north. South of the line the opposite of these characteristics is is the rule. The line of discontinuity, which can be traced for great distances, and, if observations were available, could probably be traced around the entire Northern Hemisphere, has been called the polar-front line, and may be regarded as the meeting place of polar and equatorial air. Loops occasionally form in this line, with the result that masses of warm or cold air are separated from the parent masses. These loops and their results are somewhat dependent upon the latitude of the polar-front line. Such cutting off of air masses represents the formation of highs and lows. The weather of the Northern Hemisphere is the result of the advance and recession of the polar-front line. When the warm air extends farther north than usual, there is a tendency for an accumulation of cold air north of the line. When the pressure from this accumulation becomes sufficiently great, the cold air breaks through and flows south-ward, causing a change of the type of weather. Thus, the polar-front line is of great importance in forecasting, and, as observations are extended around the earth, it may assist in long-range forecasting.---C. L. M.},

  abstract = {The Arctic region is warming at a rate more than double the global average, a trend predicted to continue by all Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) climate models. Despite this consistency, significant intermodel spread exists in the simulated Arctic climate related to differences in the Arctic surface radiation budget. Building upon previous work to characterize and understand surface radiation budget biases in climate models, the annual mean and seasonal cycle of the Arctic surface radiation budget in 17 CMIP5 models using the Historical-forcing scenario is evaluated against state-of-the-art Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System Surface Energy Balanced and Filled data. The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble is found to simulate longwave surface fluxes well during the sunlit months ({\textasciitilde}1 W m{\`A}2 differences in July) but exhibits significant wintertime biases (up to {\`A}19 W m{\`A}2). Shortwave fluxes show substantial across-model spread during summer; the model standard deviation approaches 20 W m{\`A}2 in July. Applying a decomposition analysis to the cloud radiative effect (CRE) seasonal cycles, an unrealistic compensation is uncovered between the model-simulated seasonal cycles of cloud fraction, all-sky/clear-sky flux differences, and surface albedo that enables models to simulate realistic CRE seasonal cycles with unrealistic individual contributions. This unrealistic behavior in models must be constrained to improve Arctic climate simulation; observational uncertainty is sufficient to do so. Lastly, biases in all and clear-sky longwave downwelling fluxes positively correlate with model surface temperature in winter, while in summer surface temperature is most strongly related to clear-sky upwelling radiation biases from surface albedo errors.},

  abstract = {A parameterization for surface roughness and blending height at regional scales, under neutral atmospheric stability, is studied and tested. The analysis is based on a suite of large-eddy simulations (LES) over surfaces with varying roughness height and multiple variability scales. The LES are based on the scaledependent Lagrangian dynamic subgrid-scale model, and the surface roughnesses at the ground are imposed using the rough-wall logarithmic law. Several patterns of roughness distribution are considered, including random tiling of patches with a wide distribution of length scales. An integral length scale, based on the one-dimensional structure function of the spatially variable roughness height, is used to define the characteristic surface variability scale, which is a critical input in many regional parameterization schemes. Properties of the simulated flow are discussed with special emphasis on the turbulence properties over patches of unequal roughness. The simulations are then used to assess a generalized form of the parameterization for the blending height and the equivalent surface roughness at regional scales that has been developed earlier for regular patterns of surface roughness (regular stripes). The results are also compared with other parameterizations proposed in the literature. Good agreement is found between the simulations and the regional-scale parameterization for the surface roughness and the blending height when this parameterization is combined with the characteristic surface variability scale proposed in this paper.},

  abstract = {A field experiment -- the Snow Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (SnoHATS) -- has been performed over an extensive glacier in Switzerland in order to study small-scale turbulence in the stable atmospheric surface layer, and to investigate the role, dynamics and modelling of the subgrid scales (SGSs) in the context of large-eddy simulations. The               a priori               data analysis aims at comparing the role and behaviour of the SGSs under stable conditions with previous studies under neutral or unstable conditions. It is found that the SGSs in a stable surface layer remain an important sink of temperature variance and turbulent kinetic energy from the resolved scales and carry a significant portion of the fluxes when the filter scale is larger than the distance to the wall. The fraction of SGS fluxes (out of the total fluxes) is found to be independent of stability. In addition, the stress--strain alignment is similar to the alignment under neutral and unstable conditions. The model coefficients vary considerably with stability but in a manner consistent with previous findings, which also showed that scale-dependent dynamic models can capture this variation. Furthermore, the variation of the coefficients for both momentum and heat SGS fluxes can be shown to be better explained by stability parameters based on vertical gradients, rather than vertical fluxes. These findings suggest that small-scale turbulence dynamics and SGS modelling under stable conditions share many important properties with neutral and convective conditions, and that a unified approach is thus possible. This paper concludes with a discussion of some other challenges for stable boundary-layer simulations that are not encountered in the neutral or unstable cases.},

  abstract = {Modeling small-scale turbulence is essential in numerical weather prediction systems because  turbulence contributes significantly to the transport and mixing of scalar quantities, e.g.,  temperature and momentum. In principle, the unresolved mixing in a model is mathematically  modeled based on the resolved - and thus calculated - fluid motions. Turbulence models are  formulated based on statistical flow properties and calibrated with experiments. Depending on  the state of the atmospheric turbulent boundary layer, there is a range of possible conditions  to calibrate a turbulence model. The boundary layer is particularly challenging to model in  conditions of stable stratification. The cooled surface and low wind velocity are characteristic  of this condition, which induces an insufficiently explored, so-called intermittent, turbulence.  One research approach is based on the observation that intermittent turbulence is associated  with unresolved fluid motions, called sub-mesoscale motions. The sub-mesoscales are assumed  to be independent of the large resolvable scales and thus occur sporadically in the simulation  domain. The computational grid of the weather forecasting system is too coarse to resolve  these necessary processes. The studies dealing with this problem show that with higher model  resolutions, the observational data are only represented in the statistical quantities and cannot  be predicted precisely. Motivated by this, this work develops a stochastic turbulence model  for the atmospheric Stable Boundary Layer (SBL) to account for sporadic events that cause  intermittent mixing. Thus, the present work addresses the importance of sub-mesoscales in  generating turbulence in the SBL. A data-driven equation is developed, which is modular  and easily combinable with existing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes models. For this, the  work analyzes existing field measurements collected over several months in even terrain.  The measurements are processed using a statistical model-based clustering technique. This  methodology simultaneously models and classifies the nonstationary SBL based on different  scale interactions. The clustering procedure is then developed into a stochastic parameterization  method used to identify an equation from the data. Resulting from this, the main contribution  of this work is the developed stochastic stability equation that predicts the process of transient  stability correction. This process describes the effect of the static stability of the flow on  the averaged flow variables, taking into account random perturbations hypothetically caused  by the sub-grid processes. The presented turbulence model provides a general approach to  account for the stochastic mixing effects of unresolved and mean-scale independent processes  without explicitly modeling them.},

  abstract = {The multiple-single-column approach is proposed as a new concept to study the boundary layer parameterization scheme in the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University--National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5). The results are compared with the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation Model (DALES). Numerical experiments were performed over homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces under clear convective boundary layer conditions. Identical simulations using MM5 and DALES were performed, which enabled an evaluation of the MM5 boundary layer scheme with DALES results. From the experiment with a homogeneous surface, MM5 shows a slightly shallower, colder, and moister boundary layer than DALES. This result is produced by an underestimation of turbulent mixing near the surface and less-vigorous entrainment of heat and dry air in MM5. In the heterogeneous surface experiment, the domain is divided into dry and wet patches, with the result that both models produce a mesoscale circulation. However, relative to the homogeneous case, larger differences were found between the models in the representation of the boundary layer dynamics. In DALES, the surface heterogeneity influenced the turbulent motions, making the mesoscale circulation much stronger (wmax is 6 times as large) than in MM5. Because of this stronger circulation, the boundary layer height, bulk temperature, and humidity also displayed differences in time and spatial patterns. Because of the land--atmosphere coupling in MM5, the mesoscale circulation strengthened the surface flux heterogeneity. Cold and moist air advection close to the surface from the wet patch to the dry patch increased the sensible heat flux above the dry patch and thus the induced mesoscale flow.},

  abstract = {The torque in turbulent Taylor-Couette flows for shear Reynolds numbers Re\_S up to 3x10{\textasciicircum}4 at various mean rotations is studied by means of direct numerical simulations for a radius ratio of {\textbackslash}eta=0.71. Convergence of simulations is tested using three criteria of which the agreement of dissipation values estimated from the torque and from the volume dissipation rate turns out to be most demanding. We evaluate the influence of Taylor vortex heights on the torque for a stationary outer cylinder and select a value of the aspect ratio of {\textbackslash}Gamma=2, close to the torque maximum. The connection between the torque and the transverse current J{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}omega of azimuthal motion which can be computed from the velocity field enables us to investigate the local transport resulting in the torque. The typical spatial distribution of the individual convective and viscous contributions to the local current is analysed for a turbulent flow case. To characterise the turbulent statistics of the transport, PDF's of local current fluctuations are compared to experimental wall shear stress measurements. PDF's of instantaneous torques reveal a fluctuation enhancement in the outer region for strong counter-rotation. Moreover, we find for simulations realising the same shear Re\_S{$>$}=2x10{\textasciicircum}4 the formation of a torque maximum for moderate counter-rotation with angular velocities {\textbackslash}omega\_o{\textbackslash}approx-0.4{\textbackslash}omega\_i. In contrast, for Re\_S{$<$}=4x10{\textasciicircum}3 the torque features a maximum for a stationary outer cylinder. In addition, the effective torque scaling exponent is shown to also depend on the mean rotation state. Finally, we evaluate a close connection between boundary-layer thicknesses and the torque.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of subcritical rotating, stratified and magnetohydrodynamic wall-bounded flows are performed in large computational domains, focusing on parameters where laminar and turbulent flow can stably coexist. In most cases, a regime of large-scale oblique laminar-turbulent patterns is identified at the onset of transition, as in the case of pure shear flows. The current study indicates that this oblique regime can be shifted up to large values of the Reynolds number Re by increasing the damping by the Coriolis, buoyancy or Lorentz force. We show evidence for this phenomenon in three distinct flow cases: plane Couette flow with spanwise cyclonic rotation, plane magnetohydrodynamic channel flow with a spanwise or wall-normal magnetic field, and open channel flow under stable stratification. Nearwall turbulence structures inside the turbulent patterns are invariably found to scale in terms of viscous wall units as in the fully turbulent case, while the patterns themselves remain large-scale with a trend towards shorter wavelength for increasing Re. Two distinct regimes are identified: at low Reynolds numbers the patterns extend from one wall to the other, while at large Reynolds number they are confined to the near-wall regions and the patterns on both channel sides are uncorrelated, the core of the flow being highly turbulent without any dominant large-scale structure.},

  abstract = {The directional wind turning across the boundary layer in short-range forecasts made as part of the recent ERA-40 reanalysis project is compared with radiosonde data from oceanic stations in the North Atlantic. Significant errors are identified, particularly in cases of warm advection in which it is found that the observed wind turning is systematically underestimated. Similar problems are found in the higher-resolution operational forecasts, and also in forecasts made with the independent Met Office model. Furthermore, comparisons of forecast wind direction with scatterometer data give consistent results over the North Atlantic and indicate that the same problems are present over other oceans. A large fraction of the cases with the largest errors are shown to have stable boundary layers. In these cases the modelled boundary layers are typically too deep, and sensitivity tests have shown that more realistic structures are obtained by switching to a stable boundary-layer parametrization based on Monin--Obukhov similarity. Some possible problems with the convective boundary layer parametrization in highly baroclinic conditions are also identified. Copyright {\copyright} 2005 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract = {A model proposed earlier (Brutsaert, 1965) for evaporation as a molecular diffusion process into a turbulent atmosphere is extended by joining it with the similarity models for turbulent transfer in the surface sublayer. The assumed mechanisms were suggested by available flow visualization studies near smooth and rough walls; the theoretical result is in good agreement with available experimental evidence. The important dimensionless parameters governing the phenomenon near the surface are the Dalton (or Stanton) number (i.e., mass transfer coefficient), the drag coefficient (u*2/U2), the roughness Reynolds number (u*z0/v) (except for smooth surfaces), and the Schmidt (or Prandtl) number (v/k). The proposed formulation allows the evaluation of the effects of some parameters, such as surface roughness or molecular diffusivity, that were hitherto not well understood. An important practical result is that in contrast to the drag coefficient, the Dalton number is relatively insensitive to changes in roughness length Z0.},

Taking into account the influence of changes of planetary albedo of the Earth under the development of glaciations on the thermal regime, it is found that comparatively small variations of atmospheric transparency could be sufficient for the development of quaternary glaciations.},

In all cases, favorable comparisons are obtained between G-K-S theory, eigenvalue determination, and numerical simulation. The conventional definition of stability is then sharpened to include only those spatial discretizations that are asymptotically stable (bounded, Left Half-Plane eigenvalues). It is shown that many of the higher-order schemes which are G-K-S stable are not asymptotically stable.

  abstract = {Submeso motions add complexities to the structure of the stable boundary layer. Such motions include horizontal meandering and gravity waves, in particular when the large-scale flow is weak. The coexistence and interaction of such submeso motions is investigated through the analysis of data collected in Antarctica, in persistent conditions of strong atmospheric stratification. Detected horizontal meandering is frequently associated with temperature oscillations characterized by similar time scales (30 min) at all levels (2, 4.5 and 10 m). In contrast, dirty gravity waves superimposed on horizontal meandering are detected only at the highest level, characterized by time scales of a few minutes. The meandering produces an energy peak in the low-frequency spectral range, well fitted by a spectral model previously proposed for low wind speeds. The coexistence of horizontal and vertical oscillations is observed in the presence of large wind-direction shifts superimposed on the gradual flow meandering. Such shifts are often related to the variation of the mean flow dynamics, but also to intermittent events, localized in time, which do not produce a variation in the mean wind direction and that are associated with sharp decreases in wind speed and temperature. The noisy gravity waves coexisting with horizontal meandering persist only for a few cycles and produce bursts of turbulent mixing close to the ground, affecting the exchange processes between the surface and the stable boundary layer. The results confirm the importance of sharp wind-direction changes at low wind speed in the stable atmosphere and suggest a possible correlation between observed gravity waves and dynamical instabilities modulated by horizontal meandering.},

In this framework, Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory represents one possible approach to reduce the dimensionality of the phase space. We apply this framework to study the vertical velocity variance in the canonical surface layer and in the canopy roughness sublayer above the Amazon forest. Results reveal interesting insight into the behavior of the vertical velocity variance over forests, linking its magnitude to the imbalance between local production and dissipation of TKE.},

  abstract = {Abstract Previous studies of the long-wave perturbations of the free atmosphere have been based on mathematical models which either fail to take properly into account the continuous vertical shear in the zonal current or else neglect the variations of the vertical component of the earth's angular velocity. The present treatment attempts to supply both these elements and thereby to lead to a solution more nearly in accord with the observed behavior of the atmosphere. By eliminating from consideration at the outset the meteorologically unimportant acoustic and shearing-gravitational oscillations, the perturbation equations are reduced to a system whose solution is readily obtained. Exact stability criteria are deduced, and it is shown that the instability increases with shear, lapse rate, and latitude, and decreases with wave length. Application of the criteria to the seasonal averages of zonal wind suggests that the westerlies of middle latitudes are a seat of constant dynamic instability. The unstable waves are similar in many respects to the observed perturbations: The speed of propagation is generally toward the east and is approximately equal to the speed of the surface zonal current. The waves exhibit thermal asymmetry and a westward tilt of the wave pattern with height. In the lower troposphere the maximum positive vertical velocities occur between the trough and the nodal line to the east in the pressure field. The distribution of the horizontal mass divergence is calculated, and it is shown that the notion of a fixed level of nondivergence must be replaced by that of a sloping surface of nondivergence. The Rossby formula for the speed of propagation of the barotropic wave is generalized to a baroclinic atmosphere. It is shown that the barotropic formula holds if the constant value used for the zonal wind is that observed in the neighborhood of 600 mb.},

In the case n = 1, it reduces to the two-dimensional single-layer barometric model. In the case N = 2, it reduces to the double-layer barotropic model, or --- what is shown to be mathematically equivalent ---the 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-dimensional model. Methods of numerical integration of the 2- and 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-dimensional equations, and the machine requirements for such integrations, are discussed. The results of a series of six two-dimensional and six 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-dimensional forecasts for 12 and 24 hours are presented. Although the 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-dimensional forecasts are noticeably superior to the two-dimensional forecasts, it is apparent that considerable improvement will be possible with models in which there are fewer artificial constraints. A method of integration is therefore proposed for the n-level generalization of the 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-dimensional model, and computation schemes are outlined for the general three-dimensional quasi-geostrophic equations. The semi-Lagrangian coordinate system with potential temperature as vertical coordinate is shown to exhibit favorable properties for machine integration.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses and documents a number of issues related to the implementation of an advanced land surface--hydrology model in the Penn State--NCAR fifth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5). The concept adopted here is that the land surface model should be able to provide not only reasonable diurnal variations of surface heat fluxes as surface boundary conditions for coupled models, but also correct seasonal evolutions of soil moisture in the context of a long-term data assimilation system. In a similar way to that in which the modified Oregon State University land surface model (LSM) has been used in the NCEP global and regional forecast models, it is implemented in MM5 to facilitate the initialization of soil moisture. Also, 1-km resolution vegetation and soil texture maps are introduced in the coupled MM5--LSM system to help identify vegetation/ water/soil characteristics at fine scales and capture the feedback of these land surface forcings. A monthly varying climatological 0.15{\cyrchar\CYRNJE} ϫ 0.15{\cyrchar\CYRNJE} green vegetation fraction is utilized to represent the annual control of vegetation on the surface evaporation. Specification of various vegetation and soil parameters is discussed, and the available water capacity in the LSM is extended to account for subgrid-scale heterogeneity. The coupling of the LSM to MM5 is also sensitive to the treatment of the surface layer, especially the calculation of the roughness length for heat/moisture. Including the effect of the molecular sublayer can improve the simulation of surface heat flux. It is shown that the soil thermal and hydraulic conductivities and the surface energy balance are very sensitive to soil moisture changes. Hence, it is necessary to establish an appropriate soil moisture data assimilation system to improve the soil moisture initialization at fine scales.},

  abstract = {A number of short-term numerical experiments conducted by the Penn State--NCAR fifth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5) coupled with an advanced land surface model, alongside the simulations coupled with a simple slab model, are verified with observations. For clear sky day cases, the MM5 model gives reasonable estimates of radiation forcing at the surface with solar radiation being slightly overestimated probably due to the lack of aerosol treatment in the current MM5 radiation scheme. The improvements in the calculation of surface latent and sensible heat fluxes with the new land surface model (LSM) are very apparent, and more importantly, the new LSM captures the correct Bowen ratio. Evaporation obtained from the simple slab model is significantly lower than observations. Having time-varying soil moisture is important for capturing even short-term evolution of evaporation. Due to the more reasonable diurnal cycle of surface heat fluxes in the MM5--LSM, its nearsurface temperature and humidity are closer to the FIFE observations. In particular, the MM5--slab model has a systematic warm bias in 2-m temperature. Both the slab model and the new LSM were coupled with the nonlocal Medium-Range Forecast model PBL parameterization scheme and they reproduced the depth of the morning surface inversion in the stable boundary layer well. The observed mixed layer in the late morning deepens faster than both models, despite the fact that both models have high bias in surface sensible heat fluxes. Presumably, such a rapid development of convective mixed layer is due to some effects induced by small-scale heterogeneity or large-scale advection that the MM5 failed to capture. Both surface models reasonably reproduce the daytime convective PBL growth and, in general, the temperature difference between the two models and observations is less than 2{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}. The simulations of two rainfall events are not conclusive. Both models produce a good forecast of rainfall for 24 June 1997 and have similar problems for the event of 4 July 1997, although the simulations with the new LSM have slightly improved results in some 3-h rainfall accumulations. It seems that the new LSM does not have unexpected influences in situations for which the land surface processes are secondary, but that it may have subtle, though complex, effects on the model behavior because of heterogeneity introduced by soil moisture, vegetation effects, and soil type, which are all lacking in the slab model.},

  abstract = {The large-eddy simulation of very stable boundary layers (SBLs) remains challenging due to the large anisotropy of turbulent motions resulting from buoyancy suppression effects, and to the general reduction of its energetic scales. Here, we develop a novel large-eddy simulation model setup to enable the modeling of the very SBL, avoiding the use of the Monin--Obukhov similarity theory at its lower boundary condition, as it breaks down in these conditions in agreement with previous studies. The new approach requires very fine grids in the vertical direction, in the order of a few centimeters. A series of Ekman-layer-type boundary layers under weak-wind conditions (ug=1\$\$ u\_{\textbackslash}mathrmg=1 \$\$ and 2 m{$\cdot\$\$$} {\textbackslash}cdotp \$\$s-1\$\$ {\textasciicircum}-1 \$\$), and strong surface cooling rates (1 and 3 K{$\cdot\$\$$} {\textbackslash}cdotp \$\$hr-1\$\$ {\textasciicircum}-1 \$\$) at high latitude is studied using isotropic grids of 0.05 and 0.10 m resolution. The low-order statistics show some sensitivity to the grid resolution; for example, both the SBL height and the low-level jet position decrease with increasing grid resolution. In general, some differences are spotted regarding the shape of the wind speed and temperature vertical profiles, compared with weakly to moderately stratified conditions, suggesting that the structure and characteristics of the SBL evolve with increasing stratification. Moreover, the wind turning is significant from the surface, where the surface wind angle relative to the geostrophic wind is about 50{$^\circ\$\$$} {\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \$\$. Lastly, two regimes within very stable conditions can be qualitatively identified primarily based on the gradient Richardson number (Ri\$\$ Ri \$\$) profiles: In the less stable regime, Ri\$\$ Ri \$\$ increases almost linearly with height and a quasi-steady state is achieved; however, in the most stable regime, Ri\$\$ Ri \$\$ sharply increases near the surface and remains constant throughout the SBL while increasing with time up to Ri{$\approx$}0.4\$\$ Ri{\textbackslash}approx 0.4 \$\$. Thus, a quasi-steady state is not achieved; and although turbulence does not collapse, it remains weak.},

Moreover, viscous effects likely become relevant under very weak-wind conditions. This study investigates the stratification regimes based on the relative strength of the forces that control the flow (i.e., buoyancy- or viscosity-dominated flow) and the degree of turbulence anisotropy in large-eddy simulations of the very SBL with weak winds. The simulations explored here correspond to an Ekman-layer-type boundary layer with geostrophic winds equal to ug=1\$\$ u\_{\textbackslash}mathrmg=1 \$\$ and 2 m{$\cdot\$\$$} {\textbackslash}cdotp \$\$s-1\$\$ {\textasciicircum}-1 \$\$, and surface cooling rates of 1 and 3 K{$\cdot\$\$$} {\textbackslash}cdotp \$\$hr-1\$\$ {\textasciicircum}-1 \$\$, at high latitude. According to the buoyancy Reynolds number Reb\$\$ Re\_{\textbackslash}mathrmb \$\$ and the horizontal Froude number Frh\$\$ Fr\_{\textbackslash}mathrmh \$\$, these SBLs are in strongly stable conditions (i.e., Reb{$\gg$}1\$\$ Re\_{\textbackslash}mathrmb{\textbackslash}gg 1 \$\$ and Frh{$\ll$}1\$\$ Fr\_{\textbackslash}mathrmh{\textbackslash}ll 1 \$\$). Moreover, the vertical profiles of Reb\$\$ Re\_{\textbackslash}mathrmb \$\$ indicate that the turbulent flows are in an energetic state near the surface but gradually transition to a viscosity-affected stratified state in the upper part of the SBL as viscous effects become important. For the most stable simulation, the results show that even the small scales are somewhat affected by buoyancy. The invariant analysis of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor shows that the flow is in an anisotropic state and is governed by the streamwise component of the turbulent flux u{$\prime$}u{$\prime$}-\$\$ {\o}verlineu{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}prime u{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}prime \$\$ (one-component turbulence). Additionally, based on the two-point spatial correlation function, the shape of the large coherent turbulent structures is nearly isotropic in the vertical direction and anisotropic in the horizontal direction, and their size increases with height. The evaluation of the turbulent kinetic energy budget shows that the most stable simulation is in a non-stationary state, which impacts the turbulence mixing efficiency measured by the flux Richardson number.},

The concept of persistence has been found to have many diverse practical applications, ranging from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to financial dynamics to distribution of time scales in turbulent flows and many more. In this study, we carry out a detailed analysis of the statistical characteristics of the persistence probability density functions (PDFs) of velocity and temperature fluctuations in the surface layer of a convective boundary layer using a field-experimental dataset. Our results demonstrate that for the time scales smaller than the integral scales, the persistence PDFs of turbulent velocity and temperature fluctuations display a clear power-law behavior, associated with a self-similar eddy cascading mechanism. Moreover, we also show that the effects of non-Gaussian temperature fluctuations act only at those scales that are larger than the integral scales, where the persistence PDFs deviate from the power-law and drop exponentially. Furthermore, the mean time scales of the negative temperature fluctuation events persisting longer than the integral scales are found to be approximately equal to twice the integral scale in highly convective conditions. However, with stability, this mean time scale gradually decreases to almost being equal to the integral scale in the near-neutral conditions. Contrarily, for the long positive temperature fluctuation events, the mean time scales remain roughly equal to the integral scales, irrespective of stability.},

We discover that the persistence patterns for heat and momentum fluxes are widely different. Moreover, we uncover power-law scaling and length scales of turbulent motions that cause this behavior. Furthermore, by separating the phases and amplitudes of flux events, we explain the origin and differences between heat and momentum transfer efficiencies in convective turbulence. Our findings provide a new understanding of the connection between flow organization and flux generation mechanisms, two cornerstones of turbulence research.},

The extended model retains the anisotropic form of the original stretched-vortex model, but the SGS kinetic energy and the characteristic SGS eddy size are modified by buoyancy subject to two constraints: first, the SGS kinetic energy dynamics is determined by stationary and homogeneous conditions, and second, the SGS eddy size obeys a scaling analogous to the Monin--Obukhov similarity theory. The SGS model construction, comprising an ensemble of subgrid stretched-vortical structures, naturally limits vertical mixing but allows horizontal mixing provided the alignment of the SGS vortex ensemble is favorable, even at high nominal gradient Richardson numbers. In very stable stratification, the model recovers the z-less limit, in which a vortex-based Obukhov length controls the SGS dynamics, while in very unstable stratification, the model recovers the free-convection limit, in which a vortex-based Deardorff velocity controls the SGS dynamics. The efficacy of the present SGS model is demonstrated by simulating the canonical stationary and homogeneous, stratified sheared turbulence at high Reynolds numbers and moderately high Richardson numbers. In the postprocessing, the SGS dynamics of the stretched-vortex model is further interrogated to yield predictions of buoyancy-adjusted one-dimensional SGS spectra and SGS root-mean-square velocity-derivative fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Using direct numerical simulation, we investigate stationary and homogeneous sheardriven turbulence in various stratifications, ranging from neutral to very stable. To attain and maintain a stationary flow, we throttle the mean shear so that the net production stays constant for all times. This results in a flow that is characterized solely by its mean shear and its mean buoyancy gradient, independent of initial conditions. The method of throttling is validated by comparison with experimental spectra in the case of neutral stratification. With increasing stratification comes the emergence of vertically sheared large-scale horizontal motions that preclude a straightforward interpretation of flow statistics. However, once these motions are excluded, simply by subtracting the horizontal average, the underlying flow appears amenable to the standard methods of turbulence analysis. It is shown that a direct acknowledgement of the confining influence of the periodic simulation box can lead to a meaningful physical interpretation of the large scales. Once an appropriate confinement scale is identified, many features, including horizontal spectra, flux--gradient relationships and length scales, of stratified sheared turbulence can be readily understood, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in terms of Monin--Obukhov similarity theory. Finally, the similarity-theory framework is used to interpret the scaling of the vertical diapycnal diffusivity in stratified turbulence.},

The turbulent fields are obtained directly by solving the three-dimensional time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations (using the Boussinesq approximation to account for buoyancy effects), and no turbulence model is needed. Two levels of heating are considered, one quite vigorous, the other more moderate. Statistics for the vigorously heated case are found to agree reasonably well with laboratory, field, and large-eddy simulation results, when Deardorff's mixed-layer scaling is used. No indication of large-scale longitudinal roll cells is found in this convection-dominated flow, for which the inversion height to Obukhov length scale ratio - z i / L , = 26. However, when heating is more moderate (so that - z i / L , = 2), evidence of coherent rolls is present. About 10\% of the total turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent heat flux, and 20\% of the Reynolds shear stress, are estimated to be a direct consequence of the observed cells.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) proposed by Pinelli et al. [1] is implemented for finite volume approximations of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations solutions in the open source toolbox OpenFOAM version 2.2 (ESI-OpenCFD [2]). Solid obstacles are described using a discrete forcing approach for boundary conditions. Unlike traditional approaches encompassing the presence of a solid body using conformal meshes and imposing no-slip boundary conditions on the boundary faces of the mesh, the solid body is here represented on the Eulerian Cartesian mesh through an ad-hoc body force evaluated on a set of Lagrangian markers. The markers can move across the Eulerian mesh, hence allowing for a straightforward analysis of motion or deformation of the body. The IBM method is described and implemented in PisoFOAM, whose Pressure-Implicit Split-Operator (PISO) solver is modified accordingly. The presence of the solid body and the divergence-free of the fluid velocity are imposed simultaneously by sub-iterating between IBM and the pressure correction step. This scheme allows for the use of fast optimized Poisson solvers while granting excellent accuracy with respect to the previously mentioned constraints. Various 2D and 3D well-documented test cases of flows around fixed or moving circular cylinders are simulated and carefully validated against existing data from the literature. The capability of the new solver is discussed in terms of accuracy and numerical performances.},

  abstract = {In polar regions, where the boundary layer is often stably stratified, atmospheric models produce large biases depending on the boundary-layer parametrizations and the parametrization of the exchange of energy at the surface. This model intercomparison focuses on the very stable stratification encountered over the Antarctic Plateau in 2009. Here, we analyze results from 10 large-eddy-simulation (LES) codes for different spatial resolutions over 24 consecutive hours, and compare them with observations acquired at the Concordia Research Station during summer. This is a challenging exercise for such simulations since they need to reproduce both the 300-m-deep convective boundary layer and the very thin stable boundary layer characterized by a strong vertical temperature gradient (10 K difference over the lowest 20 m) when the sun is low over the horizon. A large variability in surface fluxes among the different models is highlighted. The LES models correctly reproduce the convective boundary layer in terms of mean profiles and turbulent characteristics but display more spread during stable conditions, which is largely reduced by increasing the horizontal and vertical resolutions in additional simulations focusing only on the stable period. This highlights the fact that very fine resolution is needed to represent such conditions. Complementary sensitivity studies are conducted regarding the roughness length, the subgrid-scale turbulence closure as well as the resolution and domain size. While we find little dependence on the surface-flux parametrization, the results indicate a pronounced sensitivity to both the roughness length and the turbulence closure.},

  abstract = {Land surface models incorporate a large number of process descriptions, containing a multitude of parameters. These parameters are typically read from tabulated input files. Some of these parameters might be fixed numbers in the computer code though, which hinder model agility during calibration. Here we identified 139 hard-coded parameters in the model code of the Noah land surface model with multiple process options (Noah-MP). We performed a Sobol' global sensitivity analysis of Noah-MP for a specific set of process options, which includes 42 out of the 71 standard parameters and 75 out of the 139 hard-coded parameters. The sensitivities of the hydrologic output fluxes latent heat and total runoff as well as their component fluxes were evaluated at 12 catchments within the United States with very different hydrometeorological regimes. Noah-MP's hydrologic output fluxes are sensitive to two thirds of its applicable standard parameters (i.e., Sobol' indexes above 1\%). The most sensitive parameter is, however, a hard-coded value in the formulation of soil surface resistance for direct evaporation, which proved to be oversensitive in other land surface models as well. Surface runoff is sensitive to almost all hard-coded parameters of the snow processes and the meteorological inputs. These parameter sensitivities diminish in total runoff. Assessing these parameters in model calibration would require detailed snow observations or the calculation of hydrologic signatures of the runoff data. Latent heat and total runoff exhibit very similar sensitivities because of their tight coupling via the water balance. A calibration of Noah-MP against either of these fluxes should therefore give comparable results. Moreover, these fluxes are sensitive to both plant and soil parameters. Calibrating, for example, only soil parameters hence limit the ability to derive realistic model parameters. It is thus recommended to include the most sensitive hard-coded model parameters that were exposed in this study when calibrating Noah-MP.},

The radiation is taken into account since its contribution to the budget of the tendency of temperature is as important as the contribution of the turbulence in the surface layer. The resulting regime is a two-layer flow separated by a change of the temperature gradient at the level of maximum speed. The upper part has turbulence originated by shear production extending up to 3 times the height of wind maximum and of the same order of magnitude as in the layer below. The jet nose is seen by the model as a decoupling layer, and the use of passive scalars allows for the inspection of the amount of transport across it, which is very small. The lower layer is very sensitive to the surface boundary conditions, but the principal patterns in the upper layer do not change significantly. The runs are compared to the observations through mean profiles, time series, and probability density functions.},

The geometry, dynamics, and scaling of these interfaces are reviewed, and future lines of research are suggested. The dynamics of passive and active scalars is also discussed, including the effects of stratification, turbulence level, and internal forcing.

  abstract = {A radiatively driven cloud-top mixing layer is investigated using direct numerical simulations. This configuration mimics the mixing process across the inversion that bounds the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer. The main focus of this paper is on small-scale turbulence. The finest resolution (7.4 cm) is about two orders of magnitude finer than that in cloud large-eddy simulations (LES). A one-dimensional horizontally averaged model is employed for the radiation. The results show that the definition of the inversion point with the mean buoyancy of hbi(zi) 5 0 leads to convective turbulent scalings in the cloud bulk consistent with the Deardorff theory. Three mechanisms contribute to the entrainment by cooling the inversion layer: a molecular flux, a turbulent flux, and the direct radiative cooling by the smoke inside the inversion layer. In the simulations the molecular flux is negligible, but the direct cooling reaches values comparable to the turbulent flux as the inversion layer thickens. The results suggest that the direct cooling might be overestimated in lessresolved models like LES, resulting in an excessive entrainment. The scaled turbulent flux is independent of the stratification for the range of Richardson numbers studied here. As suggested by earlier studies, the turbulent entrainment only occurs at the small scales and eddies larger than approximately four optical lengths (60 m in a typical stratocumulus cloud) perform little or no entrainment. Based on those results, a parameterization is proposed that accounts for a large part (50\%--100\%) of the entrainment velocities measured in the Second Dynamics and Chemistry of the Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS II) campaign.},

  abstract = {The stratocumulus-top mixing process is investigated using direct numerical simulations of a shear-free cloud-top mixing layer driven by evaporative and radiative cooling. An extension of previous linear formulations allows for quantifying radiative cooling, evaporative cooling, and the diffusive effects that artificially enhance mixing and evaporative cooling in high-viscosity direct numerical simulations (DNS) and many atmospheric simulations. The diffusive cooling accounts for 20\% of the total evaporative cooling for the highest resolution (grid spacing ;14 cm), but this can be much larger (;100\%) for lower resolutions that are commonly used in large-eddy simulations (grid spacing ;5 m). This result implies that the k scaling for cloud cover might be strongly influenced by diffusive effects. Furthermore, the definition of the inversion point as the point of neutral buoyancy hbi(zi) 5 0 allows the derivation of two scaling laws. The in-cloud scaling law relates the velocity and buoyancy integral scales to a buoyancy flux defined by the inversion point. The entrainment-zone scaling law provides a relationship between the entrainment velocity and the liquid evaporation rate. By using this inversion point, it is shown that the radiative-cooling contribution to the entrainment velocity decouples from the evaporative-cooling contribution and behaves very similarly as in the smoke cloud. Finally, evaporative and radiative cooling have similar strengths, when this strength is measured by the integrated buoyancy source. This result partially explains why current entrainment parameterizations are not accurate enough, given that most of them implicitly assume that only one of the two mechanisms rules the entrainment.},

  abstract = {The effect of sedimentation on stratocumulus entrainment is investigated using direct numerical simulations of a cloud-top mixing layer driven by radiative and evaporative cooling. The simulations focus on the meter and submeter scales that are expected to be relevant for entrainment, and the finest grid spacing is Dx 5 26 cm. The entrainment velocity is investigated from the analysis of the integrated-buoyancy evolution equation, which is exactly derived from the flow evolution equations. The analysis shows that sedimentation interacts with entrainment through two different mechanisms. As previously reported, sedimentation prevents droplets from evaporating in the entrainment zone, which in turn reduces the entrainment velocity. Here it is shown that sedimentation also promotes a positive buoyancy flux that directly opposes entrainment. The strengths of both mechanisms are characterized by two different settling numbers, which allow for predicting which meteorological conditions favor the reduction of entrainment by sedimentation. These new insights allow for including sedimentation in a parameterization of the entrainment velocity. The reduction of the entrainment velocity by sedimentation predicted by the parameterization and observed in the simulations is 3 times larger than previously reported in large-eddy simulations, which implies that meter- and submeterscale turbulence plays an important role in the interaction of entrainment with sedimentation. On the whole, analysis and simulations indicate that stratocumulus entrainment is more sensitive to the cloud droplet number density due to sedimentation than previously thought.},

It is argued that classical scaling theory is best expressed in terms of the local Richardson numbers. The theory can then be extended to treat cases where classical assumptions break down. There are indications that Richardson number models with suitable boundary conditions can mimic, at least qualitatively, some features of the `very stable boundary layer'. Despite advances in research modelling, detailed observational validation remains essential.},

We present results for both neutrally, moderately and strongly stably stratified conditions. For unstratified cases, large-scale roll-like structures extending from the outer region down to the wall are observed. These structures have a clear dominant frequency and could be related to periodic oscillations or instabilities developing near the low-level jet. We discuss the effect of stratification and                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathit\{Re\}\$                                               on one-point and two-point statistics. In the strongly stratified Ekman layer we observe stable co-existing large-scale laminar and turbulent patches appearing in the form of inclined bands, similar to other wall-bounded flows. For weaker stratification, continuously sustained turbulence strongly affected by buoyancy is produced. We discuss the scaling of turbulent length scales, height of the Ekman layer, friction velocity, veering angle at the wall and heat flux.

We also consider the mixing as quantified by various versions of the flux Richardson number                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathit\{Ri\}\_\{f\}\$                                               , defined as the ratio of the conversion rate from kinetic to potential energy to the turbulent kinetic energy injection rate due to shear. We investigate how laminar and turbulent regions separately contribute to the overall mixing. Remarkably, we find that although fluctuations are greatly suppressed in the laminar regions,                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathit\{Ri\}\_\{f\}\$                                               does not change significantly compared with its value in turbulent regions. As we observe a tight coupling between the mean temperature and velocity fields, we demonstrate that both Monin--Obukhov self-similarity theory (Monin \& Obukhov,               Contrib. Geophys. Inst. Acad. Sci. USSR               , vol. 151, 1954, pp. 163--187) and the explicit algebraic model of Lazeroms               et~al.               (               J.

We thus use these models to trace out the boundary between fully developed turbulence and intermittency in the                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathit\{Re\}\{-\}{\textbackslash}mathit\{Ri\}\$                                               plane.},

  abstract = {We carry out numerical simulations of wall-bounded stably stratified flows. We mainly focus on how stratification affects the near-wall turbulence at moderate Reynolds numbers, i.e. Re{$\tau$} = 360. A set of fully-resolved open channel flow simulations is performed, where a stable stratification has been introduced through a negative heat flux at the lower wall. In agreement with previous studies, it is found that turbulence cannot be sustained for h/L values higher than 1.2, where L is the so-called Monin-Obukhov length and h is the height of the open channel. For smaller values, buoyancy does not re-laminarize the flow, but nevertheless affects the wall turbulence. Near-wall streaks are weakly affected by stratification, whereas the outer modes are increasingly damped as we move away from the wall. A decomposition of the wall-normal velocity is proposed in order to separate the gravity wave and turbulent flow fields. This method has been tested both for open channel and full channel flows. Gravity waves are likely to develop and to dominate close to the upper boundary (centerline for full channel). However, their intensity is weaker in the open channel, possibly due to the upper boundary condition. Moreover, the presence of internal gravity waves can also be deduced from a correlation analysis, which reveals (together with spanwise spectra) a narrowing of the outer structures as the stratification is increased.},

With the exception of the normalized second moment of temperature, very little variation of the normalized moments was found with changes in the dimensionless stability parameter ff = z / L , where L is the Obukhov stability length. Such limited variation is expected for stable conditions, and the normalized second moment of temperature might have been affected by nonstationary conditions. In addition, the variability of the normalized moments was lessened by computing the turbulence statistics over 56 min, instead of 26 rain. Values of third-order moments involving the vertical velocity were all close to zero.},

  abstract = {A systematic evaluation is conducted of the smoothed spectrum, which is a spectral estimate obtained by averaging over a window of contiguous frequencies. The technique is extended to the ogive, as well as to the cross-spectrum. It is shown that, combined with existing variance estimates for the periodogram, the variance---and therefore the random error---associated with these estimates can be calculated in a straightforward way. The smoothed spectra and ogives are biased estimates; with simple power-law analytical models, correction procedures are devised, as well as a global constraint that enforces Parseval's identity. Several new results are thus obtained: (1) The analytical variance estimates compare well with the sample variance calculated for the Bartlett spectrum and the variance of the inertial subrange of the cospectrum is shown to be relatively much larger than that of the spectrum. (2) Ogives and spectra estimates with reduced bias are calculated. (3) The bias of the smoothed spectrum and ogive is shown to be negligible at the higher frequencies. (4) The ogives and spectra thus calculated have better frequency resolution than the Bartlett spectrum, with (5) gradually increasing variance and relative error towards the low frequencies. (6) Power-law identification and extraction of the rate of dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy are possible directly from the ogive. (7) The smoothed cross-spectrum is a valid inner product and therefore an acceptable candidate for coherence and spectral correlation coefficient estimation by means of the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality. The quadrature, phase function, coherence function and spectral correlation function obtained from the smoothed spectral estimates compare well with the classical ones derived from the Bartlett spectrum.},

Validation of its dynamical core against a test suite for numerical weather forecasting has been recently published by Z{\texteuro}angl et al. (2014). In the present work, an extension of ICON is presented that enables it to perform as a large eddy simulation (LES) model. The details of the implementation of the LES turbulence scheme in ICON are explained and test cases are performed to validate it against two standard LES models. Despite the limitations that ICON inherits from being a unified modeling system, it performs well in capturing the mean flow characteristics and the turbulent statistics of two simulated flow configurations---one being a dry convective boundary layer and the other a cumulustopped planetary boundary layer.},

  abstract = {A simple two-point closure scheme for homogeneous axisymmetric turbulence is developed. For the isotropic case it is essentially an eddy-viscosity assumption in real space for the K{\'a}rm{\'a}n-Howarth equation. The eddy-viscosity function for large internal Reynolds numbers is derived from Kolmogoroff's 1941 theory. For moderate Reynold's numbers of order 10               2               , approximately the same expression for the eddy-viscosity function is determined from experimental data. The resulting closed equation for the double-correlation function is solved numerically for both large and moderate Reynolds numbers, and the results are compared with experimental data. Self-similar solutions of the basic equation predict turbulent energy decay inversely proportional to time. It is shown that the departure from this `initial-period decay law' observed in laboratory data is due to the behaviour of grid-produced correlation functions for large separation distances.},

  abstract = {In analogy to the nocturnal atmospheric boundary layer, a flux-driven, cooled channel flow is studied using direct numerical simulations. In agreement with earlier studies, turbulence collapses when the surface cooling exceeds a critical value. In that case, laminarization occurs. Here, the so-called maximum sustainable heat flux (MSHF) hypothesis is tested. It explains why laminarization will occur at strong cooling rates. It states that in stratified flows the downward heat flux is limited to a maximum, which, in turn, is determined by the momentum of the flow. If the heat extraction at the surface exceeds this maximum, near-surface stability will increase rapidly, which hampers efficient vertical heat transport further. This positive feedback eventually causes turbulence to be suppressed fully by the intensive density stratification. This framework is used to predict the collapse of turbulence and a good agreement between theory and simulations is found. Therefore, it is concluded that the maximum sustainable heat flux mechanism explains the collapse of turbulence in this kind of flow. In future work, there is the need for an extension to more realistic configurations, allowing for Coriolis effects and more realistic surface boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {The coastal discontinuity imposes strong signals to the atmospheric conditions over the sea that are important for wind-energy potential. Here, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the influence of the land--sea transition on wind conditions in the Baltic Sea using data from an offshore meteorological tower, data from a wind farm, and mesoscale model simulations. Results show a strong induced stable stratification when warm inland air flows over a colder sea. This stratification demonstrates a strong diurnal pattern and is most pronounced in spring when the land--sea temperature difference is greatest. The strength of the induced stratification is proportional to this parameter and inversely proportional to fetch. Extended periods of stable stratification lead to increased influence of inertial oscillations and increased frequency of low-level jets. Furthermore, heterogeneity in land-surface roughness along the coastline is found to produce pronounced horizontal streaks of reduced wind speeds that under stable stratification are advected several tens of kilometres over the sea. The intensity and length of the streaks dampen as atmospheric stability decreases. Increasing sea surface roughness leads to a deformation of these streaks with increasing fetch. Slight changes in wind direction shift the path of these advective streaks, which when passing through an offshore wind farm are found to produce large fluctuations in wind power. Implications of these coastline effects on the accurate modelling and forecasting of offshore wind conditions, as well as damage risk to the turbine, are discussed.},

Measurements show enhanced wake effects in the SABL compared to the unstable situation. Another influence on the power generation of an offshore wind farm is the distance of the wind farm to the shore. This is accounted for in the LES by a modification of surface characteristics at the coastal discontinuity.

While previous studies have shown that such deviations can be explained by a vertical eddy viscosity varying with depth, as opposed to the constant profile taken by Ekman, analytical progress has been impeded by the difficulty in solving Ekman's equation. Herein, we present a solution for piecewise-constant eddy viscosity which enables a comprehensive understanding of how the surface deflection angle depends on the vertical profile of eddy viscosity. For two layers, the dimensionless problem depends only on the depth of the upper layer and the ratio of layer viscosities. A single diagram then allows one to understand the dependence of the deflection angle on these two parameters.},

Further, the formation, growth and dissipation of fog in the SBL are studied both from observations and from a one-dimensional ensemble averaged turbulence closure model. The model is compared with detailed observations that were made for both a shallow (about 30 m) radiation fog and a deep (about 200 m) fog layer at the 200-m tower at Cabauw in the Netherlands. The model describes adequately the most important mechanisms occurring during the fog evolution. In this study special attention is given to the parameterization of the vegetation, which is important for a good representation of the (minimum) air temperature. The influence of turbulence transport, longwave radiative cooling and gravitational droplet settling on the fog evolution is described. The study demonstrates the need for more accurate measurements of turbulence quantities, especially the master length scale, in a variety of SBLs.},

The temperature profile of a nocturnal radiative boundary layer, developing after the evening transition, is found to be well described in terms of radiative cooling to the surface, although radiative exchanges within the atmosphere become increasingly important with time. The treatment of non-black surfaces is discussed in some detail and it is shown that the effect of reducing the surface emissivity is to decrease rather than to increase the radiative cooling rate in the surface layer. It is also argued that an accurate assessment of the impact of non-black surfaces requires careful attention to the spectral and directional characteristics of the surface emissivity. A polar nocturnal boundary layer, developing above snow-covered ground, is simulated and found to reach a slowly evolving state characterized by a strong radiative divergence near the surface that is comparable to observed values. Radiative boundary layers are characterized by large temperature gradients near the surface.},

The formation of these SHIs is usually associated with large-scale advection of humid air masses. However, the potential coupling of SHIs with cloud layers by turbulent processes is not fully understood. In this study, we analyze a 3 d period of a persistent layer of increased specific humidity above a stratocumulus cloud observed during an Arctic field campaign in June 2017. The tethered balloon system BELUGA (Balloon-bornE moduLar Utility for profilinG the lower Atmosphere) recorded vertical profile data of meteorological, turbulence, and radiation parameters in the atmospheric boundary layer. An in-depth discussion of the problems associated with humidity measurements in cloudy environments leads to the conclusion that the observed SHIs do not result from measurement artifacts. We analyze two different scenarios for the SHI in relation to the cloud top capped by a temperature inversion: (i) the SHI coincides with the cloud top, and (ii) the SHI is vertically separated from the lowered cloud top. In the first case, the SHI and the cloud layer are coupled by turbulence that extends over the cloud top and connects the two layers by turbulent mixing. Several profiles reveal downward virtual sensible and latent heat fluxes at the cloud top, indicating entrainment of humid air supplied by the SHI into the cloud layer. For the second case, a downward moisture transport at the base of the SHI and an upward moisture flux at the cloud top is observed. Therefore, the area between the cloud top and SHI is supplied with moisture from both sides. Finally, large-eddy simulations (LESs) complement the observations by modeling a case of the first scenario. The simulations reproduce the observed downward turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture at the cloud top. The LES realizations suggest that in the presence of a SHI, the cloud layer remains thicker and the temperature inversion height is elevated.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Typical urban features in the profiles and differences to measurements at rural sites are discussed. Typical urban features are a greater slope in the wind profiles, enhanced turbulence intensities, and a vertical increase in magnitude of the turbulence. The analytical approach proposed by ETLING (2002) for the description of the vertical wind profile in the whole boundary layer is amended in the Prandtl-layer part by a correction function for atmospheric stability. The amended profile description turns out to render the best results for the approximation of urban wind profiles within the lowest 500 m above ground.},

  abstract = {Theoretical analysis of boundary layer turbulence has suggested a feasibility of sufficiently accurate turbulence resolving simulations at relatively coarse meshes. However, large eddy simulation (LES) codes, which employ traditional eddy-viscosity turbulence closures, fail to provide adequate turbulence statistics at coarse meshes especially within a surface layer. Manual tuning of parameters in these turbulence closures may correct low order turbulence statistics but severely harms spectra of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). For more than decade, engineering LES codes successfully employ dynamic turbulence closures. A dynamic Smagorinsky turbulence closure (DSM) has been already tried in environmental LES. The DSM is able to provide adequate turbulence statistics at coarse meshes but it is not completely consistent with the LES equations. This paper investigates applicability of an advanced dynamic mixed turbulence closure (DMM) to simulations of Ekman boundary layers of high Reynolds number flows. The DMM differs from the DSM by explicit calculation of the Leonard term in the turbulence stress tensor. The Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (HATS) field program has revealed that the Leonard term is indeed an important component of the real turbulence stress tensor.},

In practice, curves data are usually collected in a discrete form and hence they must be pre-processed to use purely functional techniques. However, in the context of k-sample tests, the pre-processing step can have effects in terms of power reduction. Hall and Van Keilegom (Stat Sin 17:1511--1531, 2007) proposed a methodology to minimizing these effects in the context of tests for the equality of two distribution functions. Their procedure is here extended to the case of k-sample hypothesis tests. The asymptotic validity of the procedure is established and its finite sample performance is analyzed through Monte Carlo experiments. As an illustration, the method is applied to air quality data collected from several monitoring stations placed at different geographical locations at the center of Spain.},

This paper describes steps taken to improve the algorithm in several ways. The number of iterations to solve for stability has been shortened from 20 to 3, and adjustments have been made to the basic profile stability functions. The scalar transfer coefficients have been redefined in terms of the mixing ratio, which is the fundamentally conserved quantity, rather than the measured water vapor mass concentration. Both the velocity and scalar roughness lengths have been changed. For the velocity roughness, the original fixed value of the Charnock parameter has been replaced by one that increases with wind speeds of between 10 and 18 m s Ϫ1. The scalar roughness length parameterization has been simplified to fit both an early set of NOAA/Environmental Technology Laboratory (ETL) experiments and the Humidity Exchange Over the Sea (HEXOS) program. These changes slightly increase the fluxes for wind speeds exceeding 10 m sϪ1. For interested users, two simple parameterizations of the surface gravity wave influence on fluxes have been added (but not evaluated).},

  abstract = {The scaling arguments presented by [J. Fluid Mech. 204 (1989) 1] to justify the Nu \$ Ra2=7 power law observed in high Rayleigh number thermal convection also have implications regarding the distribution of velocity and temperature fluctuations within the turbulent layer. Asymptotic matching of the inner scaling law and the outer scaling law implies that the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) vertical velocity fluctuation varies as rw \$ ln z, and the r.m.s. temperature fluctuation varies as rh \$ ln z or rh \$ z{\`A}1=2 depending on the details of the modeling assumptions [Exp. Fluids 4 (1986) 121]. These results differ markedly from the Priestley similarity theory [Turbulent Transport in the Lower Atmosphere, 1959], in which rw \$ z1=3 and rh \$ z{\`A}1=3. Consequently, the r.m.s. velocity and temperature profiles offer the possibility to distinguish between the two theories. We present measurements in wide-aspect-ratio convection over the range Ra {$\frac{1}{4}$} 107--109 that support the logarithmic variation for both the temperature and velocity. {\'O} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

One possible reason for this is that wave-turbulence interaction can result in significant energy coupling between turbulence within the planetary boundary layer and the mean flow outside the PBL. Three regimes are described where wave-turbulence interaction forms a significant part of the dynamics. In the first, energy and momentum flows are confined within the PBL and do not preclude local scaling. In the other two, which involve topographically forced waves and propagating waves respectively, energy/momentum transfers across the PBL make success in local scaling unlikely.},

In the present work we perform direct numerical simulation of a turbulent open channel flow with a constant (cooling) heat flux imposed at the ground. This configuration provides a very simplified model for the surface layer at night. As a result of the ground cooling, the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent fluctuations near the ground re-adjust on times of the order of L/u{$\tau$} , where L is the Obukhov length scale and u{$\tau$} is the friction velocity. For relatively weak cooling turbulence survives, but when ReL = Lu{$\tau$} /{$\nu$} 100 turbulence collapses, a situation that is also observed in the ABL. This criterion, which can be locally measured in the field, is justified in terms of the scale separation between the largest and smallest structures of the dynamic sublayer.},

We conclude that the vortex clusters of the turbulent outer region either originate away from the wall, or quickly forget their origin, in agreement with Townsend's similarity hypothesis.},

  abstract = {We investigate by means of direct numerical simulation how large-scale circulations produce deviations from Monin--Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) in the limit of free convection, disentangling the role of large-scale downdrafts from updrafts using conditional analysis. We compare the convective boundary layer to two other free-convective flows: Rayleigh--B{\'e}nard convection with an adiabatic top lid and classical Rayleigh--B{\'e}nard convection. This serves a dual purpose: firstly, to ascertain how changes in the upper boundary conditions and thereby in the large-scale circulations modify the near-surface behaviour and secondly, to assess to what extent we can extrapolate results from idealized systems to the unstable atmospheric surface layer. Using a low-pass filter to define the large scales we find that, whilst deviations from MOST occur within large-scale downdraft regions, strong deviations also occur within large-scale updraft regions. The deviations within updrafts are independent of the filter length scale used to define the large-scale circulations, independent of whether updrafts are defined as ascending air, or as air that is both ascending and positively buoyant, and are not due to changes with height of the updraft area fraction. This suggests that even updraft properties are not just determined locally, but also by outer scales. Cold, strong downdrafts in classical Rayleigh--B{\'e}nard convection notably modify the near-surface behaviour compared to the other two systems. For the moderate Reynolds numbers considered, Rayleigh--B{\'e}nard convection with an adiabatic top lid thus seems more appropriate than classical Rayleigh--B{\'e}nard convection for studying the unstable atmospheric surface layer in the limit of free convection.},

  abstract = {Abstract Conventional analysis has shown that strong wind shear enhances the entrainment buoyancy flux in the convective boundary layer. By conditioning the entrainment zone into regions of turbulent (i.e., strongly vortical) and nonturbulent (i.e., weakly vortical) flow, some unexpected aspects of this process are revealed. It is found that turbulent regions contribute the most to the entrainment buoyancy flux, but that as wind shear increases, the magnitude of the buoyancy flux in turbulent regions remains approximately constant, or even decreases, despite substantially stronger buoyancy fluctuations. The reason is that the correlation between buoyancy and vertical velocity fluctuations decreases with increasing wind shear, to the extent that it compensates the stronger buoyancy fluctuations. In free convection, this correlation is high because the vertical velocity is mainly determined by the buoyancy force acting in the same direction. Under strong shear conditions, buoyancy is no longer the only external source of vertical velocity fluctuations and their correlation consequently decreases. Hence, shear enhancement of the buoyancy flux in the entrainment zone is primarily due to an increase of the turbulent area fraction, rather than a change of flux inside the turbulent regions.},

  abstract = {The Arctic is undergoing rapid changes due to global warming, including the expansion of the marginal ice zone (MIZ), a zone of mixed ice and open water surfaces. To predict the atmospheric interaction with these surfaces, a critical process in climate models, this paper examines a simplified theoretical framework to non-dimensionalize the dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over a mixed ice-water surface (MIZ--ABL). A heterogeneity Richardson number, \$\${\textbackslash}text \{Ri\}\_h\$\$, is proposed to account for the difference in temperature between the ice and water surface in relation to the synoptic pressure gradient forcing. With the wind angle relative to the ice-water interface, \$\${\textbackslash}alpha \$\$, this framework hypothesizes that these two dimensionless numbers, regardless of individual dimensional variables (surface temperature and geostrophic wind speed) are sufficient to predict the MIZ--ABL dynamics. To test this framework, large-eddy simulations were employed over half-ice and half-water surfaces, with varying surface temperatures and geostrophic wind velocities. While the surface heat fluxes over ice, water, and the aggregate surface seem to be captured reasonably well by \$\${\textbackslash}alpha \$\$and Ri\$\$\_h\$\$, the mean wind and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles were not, suggesting that not only the difference in stability between the two surface, but also the individual stabilities over each surface influence the dynamics. The wind angle had a significant impact on the results, both in terms of heat fluxes at the surface, turbulent and dispersive fluxes in the MIZ--ABL, and the structure of the secondary circulations. When wind blows perpendicular to the water-ice interface, internal boundary layers are favoured except at the highest Ri\$\$\_h\$\$simulated. For cases with wind parallel to the interface, large rolls parallel to the shore emerge. The paper raises at least as many questions as it answers, highlighting the need for further studies of the MIZ--ABL.},

It is shown that large-scale, long-time sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies may be explained naturally as the response of the oceanic surface layers to short-time-scale atmospheric forcing. The whitenoise spectrum of the atmospheric input produces a red response spectrum, with most of the variance concentrated in very long periods. Without stabilizing negative feedback, the oceanic response would be nonstationary, the total SST variance growing indefinitely with time. With negative feedback, the response is asymptotically stationary. These effects are illustrated through numerical experiments with a very simple ocean-atmosphere model. The model reproduces the principal features and orders of magnitude of the observed SST anomalies in mid-latitudes. Independent support of the stochastic forcing model is provided by direct comparisons of observed sensible and latent heat flux spectra with SST anomaly spectra, and also by the structure of the cross correlation functions of atmospheric surface pressure and SST anomaly patterns. The numerical model is further used to simulate anomalies in the near-surface thermocline through Ekman pumping driven by the curl of the wind stress. The results suggest that short-time-scale atmospheric forcing should be regarded as a possible candidate for the origin of large-scale, low-periodvariability in the seasonal thermocline.},

That study and this companion paper were motivated by the ubiquity of multiscale GW--FS superpositions throughout the atmosphere. These DNSs exhibit combinations of wave--wave interactions and local instabilities that depart significantly from those accompanying idealized GWs or mean flows alone, surprising dependence of the flow evolution on the details of the FS, and an interesting additional pathway to instability and turbulence due to GW--FS superpositions. This paper examines the mechanical and thermal energy dissipation rates occurring in two of these DNSs. Findings include 1) dissipation that tends to be much more localized and variable than that due to GW instability in the absence of FS, 2) dissipation statistics indicative of multiple turbulence sources, 3) strong influences of FS shears on instability occurrence and turbulence intensities and statistics, and 4) significant differences between mechanical and thermal dissipation rate fields having potentially important implications for measurements of these flows.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Four idealized direct numerical simulations are performed to examine the dynamics arising from the superposition of a monochromatic gravity wave (GW) and sinusoidal linear and rotary fine structure in the velocity field. These simulations are motivated by the ubiquity of such multiscale superpositions throughout the atmosphere. Three simulations explore the effects of linear fine structure alignment along, orthogonal to, and at 458 to the plane of GW propagation. These reveal that fine structure alignment with the GW enables strong wave--wave interactions, strong deformations of the initial flow components, and rapid transitions to local instabilities and turbulence. Increasing departures of fine structure alignment from the GW yield increasingly less efficient wave--wave interactions and weaker or absent local instabilities. The simulation having rotary fine structure velocities yields wave--wave interactions that agree closely with the aligned linear fine structure case. Differences in the aligned GW fields are only seen following the onset of local instabilities, which are delayed by about 1--2 buoyancy periods for rotary fine structure compared to aligned, linear fine structure. In all cases, local instabilities and turbulence primarily accompany strong superposed shears or fluid ``intrusions'' within the rising, and least statically stable, phase of the GW. For rotary fine structure, local instabilities having preferred streamwise or spanwise orientations often arise independently, depending on the character of the larger-scale flow. Wave--wave interactions play the greatest role in reducing the initial GW amplitude whereas fine structure shears and intrusions are the major source of instability and turbulence energies.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric gravity waves have been a subject of intense research activity in recent years because of their myriad effects and their major contributions to atmospheric circulation, structure, and variability. Apart from occasionally strong lower-atmospheric effects, the major wave influences occur in the middle atmosphere, between {$\sim$} 10 and 110 km altitudes, because of decreasing density and increasing wave amplitudes with altitude. Theoretical, numerical, and observational studies have advanced our understanding of gravity waves on many fronts since the review by Fritts [1984a]; the present review will focus on these more recent contributions. Progress includes a better appreciation of gravity wave sources and characteristics, the evolution of the gravity wave spectrum with altitude and with variations of wind and stability, the character and implications of observed climatologies, and the wave interaction and instability processes that constrain wave amplitudes and spectral shape. Recent studies have also expanded dramatically our understanding of gravity wave influences on the large-scale circulation and the thermal and constituent structures of the middle atmosphere. These advances have led to a number of parameterizations of gravity wave effects which are enabling ever more realistic descriptions of gravity wave forcing in large-scale models. There remain, nevertheless, a number of areas in which further progress is needed in refining our understanding of and our ability to describe and predict gravity wave influences in the middle atmosphere. Our view of these unknowns and needs is also offered.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to determine the mechanism that modulates the initiation of convection within convergence zones caused by land surface--induced mesoscale flows. An idealized modeling approach linked quantitatively to observations of vegetation breezes over tropical Benin was used. A large-eddy model was used with a prescribed land surface describing heterogeneities between crop and forest over which vegetation breezes have been observed. The total surface fluxes were constant but the Bowen ratio varied with vegetation type. The heterogeneous land surface created temperature differences consistent with observations, which in turn forced mesoscale winds and convection at the convergence zones over the crop boundaries. At these convergence zones optimum conditions for the initiation of convection were found in the afternoon; the equivalent potential temperature was higher in the convergence zones than over anywhere else in the domain, due to reduced entrainment, and the mesoscale convergence produced a persistent increase in vertical wind velocities of up to 0.5 m s21 over a 5--10-km region. The relative importance of these two mechanisms depended on the synoptic conditions. When convective inhibition was weak, the thermodynamic conditions at the convergence zone were most important, as the triggering of convection was easily accomplished. However, when the thermodynamic profile inhibited convection, the mesoscale updrafts became essential for triggering in order to break through the inhibiting barrier. At the same time, subsidence over the forest produced a warm capping layer over the boundary layer top that suppressed convection over the forest throughout the afternoon.},

  abstract = {The entrainment zone (EZ) of a dry, shear-free convective boundary layer growing into a linearly stratified fluid is studied by means of direct numerical simulation. The scale separation between the boundary layer thickness and the Kolmogorov length scale is shown to be sufficient to observe Reynolds number similarity in the statistics of interest during the equilibrium entrainment regime. Contrary to previous considerations, the vertical structure of the entrainment zone is found to be better described by the superposition of two sublayers: 1) an upper EZ sublayer that is dominated by overshooting thermals and is characterized by a penetration depth that scales with the ratio of the convective velocity and the buoyancy frequency of the free troposphere and 2) a lower EZ sublayer that is dominated by troughs of mixed fluid and is characterized by the integral length scale of the mixed layer. Correspondingly, different buoyancy scales are identified. The consequences of this multiplicity of scales on the entrainment rate parameters are evaluated directly, without resorting to any bulk model, through an exact relation among the mean entrainment rate, the local buoyancy increment, and both the turbulent and the finite-thickness contributions to the entrainment ratio A measured at the height of minimum buoyancy flux. The smaller turbulent contribution to A that is usually observed for relatively thick EZs is found to be compensated by the smaller local buoyancy increment instead of by the finite-thickness contribution. The two-layer structure of the entrainment zone is found to affect the exponent of the power-law relation between the normalized mean entrainment rate and the convective Richardson number such that the exponent deviates from 21 for typical atmospheric conditions, although it asymptotically approaches 21 for higher Richardson numbers.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Continental-scale hyper-resolution simulations constitute a grand challenge in characterizing nonlinear feedbacks of states and fluxes of the coupled water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles of terrestrial systems. Tackling this challenge requires advanced coupling and supercomputing technologies for earth system models that are discussed in this study, utilizing the example of the implementation of the newly developed Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP v1.0) on JUQUEEN (IBM Blue Gene/Q) of the J{\"u}lich Supercomputing Centre, Germany. The applied coupling strategies rely on the Multiple Program Multiple Data (MPMD) paradigm using the OASIS suite of external couplers, and require memory and load balancing considerations in the exchange of the coupling fields between different component models and the allocation of computational resources, respectively. Using the advanced profiling and tracing tool Scalasca to determine an optimum load balancing leads to a 19\% speedup. In massively parallel supercomputer environments, the coupler OASIS-MCT is recommended, which resolves memory limitations that may be significant in case of very large computational domains and exchange fields as they occur in these specific test cases and in many applications in terrestrial research. However, model I/O and initialization in the petascale range still require major attention, as they constitute true big data challenges in light of future exascale computing resources. Based on a factor-two speedup due to compiler optimizations, a refactored coupling interface using OASIS-MCT and an optimum load balancing, the problem size in a weak scaling study can be increased by a factor of 64 from 512 to 32 768 processes while maintaining parallel efficiencies above 80\% for the component models.},

  abstract = {The onset of moist convection over land is investigated using a conceptual approach with a slab boundary layer model. The authors determine the essential factors for the onset of boundary layer clouds over land and study their relative importance. They are 1) the ratio of the temperature to the moisture lapse rates of the free troposphere, that is, the inversion Bowen ratio; 2) the mean daily surface temperature; 3) the relative humidity of the free troposphere; and 4) the surface evaporative fraction. A clear transition is observed between two regimes of moistening of the boundary layer as assessed by the relative humidity at the boundary layer top. In the first so-called wet soil advantage regime, the moistening results from the increase of the mixedlayer specific humidity, which linearly depends on the surface evaporative fraction and inversion Bowen ratio through a dynamic boundary layer factor. In the second so-called dry soil advantage regime, the relative humidity tendency at the boundary layer top is controlled by the thermodynamics and changes in the moist adiabatic induced by the decreased temperature at the boundary layer top and consequent reduction in saturation water vapor pressure. This regime pertains to very deep boundary layers under weakly stratified free troposphere over hot surface conditions. In the context of the conceptual model, a rise in freetropospheric temperature (global warming) increases the occurrence of deep convection and reduces the cloud cover over moist surfaces. This study provides new intuition and predictive capacity on the mechanism controlling the occurrence of moist convection over land.},

  abstract = {The exact time-dependent three-dimensional Navier-Stokes and temperature equations are integrated numerically to simulate stably stratified homogeneous turbulent shear flows at moderate Reynolds numbers whose horizontal mean velocity and mean temperature have uniform vertical gradients. The method uses shear-periodic boundary conditions and a combination of finite-difference and pseudospectral approximations. The gradient Richardson number               Ri               is varied between 0 and 1. The simulations start from isotropic Gaussian fields for velocity and temperature both having the same variances.                                         The simulations represent approximately the conditions of the experiment by Komori               et al.               (1983) who studied stably stratified flows in a water channel (molecular Prandtl number               Pr               = 5). In these flows internal gravity waves build up, superposed by hot cells leading to a persistent counter-gradient heat-flux (CGHF) in the vertical direction, i.e. heat is transported from lower-temperature to higher-temperature regions. Further, simulations with               Pr               = 0.7 for air have been carried out in order to investigate the influence of the molecular Prandtl number. In these cases, no persistent CGHF occurred. This confirms our general conclusion that the counter-gradient heat flux develops for strongly stable flows (               Ri               {$\approx$} 0.5--1.0) at sufficiently large Prandtl numbers (               Pr               = 5). The flux is carried by hot ascending, as well as cold descending turbulent cells which form at places where the highest positive and negative temperature fluctuations initially existed. Buoyancy forces suppress vertical motions so that the cells degenerate to two-dimensional fossil turbulence. The counter-gradient heat flux acts to enforce a quasi-static equilibrium between potential and kinetic energy.                                         Previously derived turbulence closure models for the pressure-strain and pressure-temperature gradients in the equations for the Reynolds stress and turbulent heat flux are tested for moderate-Reynolds-number flows with strongly stable stratification (               Ri               = 1). These models overestimate the turbulent interactions and underestimate the buoyancy contributions. The dissipative timescale ratio for stably stratified turbulence is a strong function of the Richardson number and is inversely proportional to the molecular Prandtl number of the fluid.},

  abstract = {We develop a framework for simulating measure-preserving, ergodic dynamical systems on a quantum computer. Our approach provides an operator-theoretic representation of classical dynamics by combining ergodic theory with quantum information science. The resulting quantum embedding of classical dynamics (QECD) enables efficient simulation of spaces of classical observables with exponentially large dimension using a quadratic number of quantum gates. The QECD framework is based on a quantum feature map that we introduce for representing classical states by density operators on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, H. Furthermore, an embedding of classical observables into self-adjoint operators on H is established, such that quantum mechanical expectation values are consistent with pointwise function evaluation. In this scheme, quantum states and observables evolve unitarily under the lifted action of Koopman evolution operators of the classical system. Moreover, by virtue of the reproducing property of H, the quantum system is pointwise-consistent with the underlying classical dynamics. To achieve a quantum computational advantage, we project the state of the quantum system onto a finite-rank density operator on a 2n-dimensional tensor product Hilbert space associated with n qubits. By employing discrete Fourier-Walsh transforms of spectral functions, the evolution operator of the finite-dimensional quantum system is factorized into tensor product form, enabling implementation through an n-channel quantum circuit of size O(n) and no interchannel communication. Furthermore, the circuit features a state preparation stage, also of size O(n), and a quantum Fourier transform stage of size O(n2), which makes predictions of observables possible by measurement in the standard computational basis. We prove theoretical convergence results for these predictions in the large-qubit limit, n{$\rightarrow\infty$}. In light of these properties, QECD provides a consistent simulator of the evolution of classical observables, realized through projective quantum measurement, which is able to simulate spaces of classical observables of dimension 2n using circuits of size O(n2). We demonstrate the consistency of the scheme in prototypical dynamical systems involving periodic and quasiperiodic oscillators on tori. These examples include simulated quantum circuit experiments in Qiskit Aer, as well as actual experiments on the IBM Quantum System One.},

The novelty of the proposed IBM lies in its simplicity, accuracy, scalability and its ability to simulate both fixed and moving immersed objects. The new IBM is thoroughly validated against a 1D benchmark, with the 2D flow around a cylinder at Re=40 and 300 and the 3D flow around a sphere at Re=300 and Re=3700. Convergence studies and detailed error maps showing the spatial distribution of the velocity L2-Norm error compared to a spectral reference solution for the cylinders at Re=40 show the robustness of the proposed method. The cost and performance of the method are also presented for multi-billion mesh node simulations with up to 65,536 computational cores. The potential of the method in handling multiple moving objects for practical applications is demonstrated with the control of a square bluff body wake by two rear pitching flaps.},

  abstract = {Two formulations of the surface thermal boundary condition commonly employed in numerical modelling of atmospheric stably stratified surface-layer flows are evaluated using analytical considerations and observational data from the Cabauw site in the Netherlands. The first condition is stated in terms of the surface heat flux and the second is stated in terms of the vertical potential temperature difference. The similarity relationships used to relate the flux and the difference are based on conventional log-linear expressions for vertical profiles of wind velocity and potential temperature. The heat-flux formulation results in two physically meaningful values for the friction velocity with no obvious criteria available to choose between solutions. Both solutions can be obtained numerically, which casts doubt on discarding one of the solutions as was previously suggested based on stability arguments. This solution ambiguity problem is identified as the key issue of the heat-flux condition formulation. In addition, the agreement between the temperature difference evaluated from similarity solutions and their measurement-derived counterparts from the Cabauw dataset appears to be very poor. Extra caution should be paid to the iterative procedures used in the model algorithms realizing the heat-flux condition as they could often provide only partial solutions for the friction velocity and associated temperature difference. Using temperature difference as the lower boundary condition bypasses the ambiguity problem and provides physically meaningful values of heat flux for a broader range of stability condition in terms of the flux Richardson number. However, the agreement between solutions and observations of the heat flux is again rather poor. In general, there is a great need for practicable similarity relationships capable of treating the vertical turbulent transport of momentum and heat under conditions of strong stratification in the surface layer.},

  abstract = {As computing capabilities expand, operational and research environments are moving toward the use of finescale atmospheric numerical models. These models are attractive for users who seek an accurate description of small-scale turbulent motions. One such numerical tool is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which has been extensively used in synoptic-scale and mesoscale studies. As finer-resolution simulations become more desirable, it remains a question whether the model features originally designed for the simulation of larger-scale atmospheric flows will translate to adequate reproductions of small-scale motions. In this study, turbulent flow in the dry atmospheric convective boundary layer (CBL) is simulated using a conventional large-eddy-simulation (LES) code and the WRF model applied in an LES mode. The two simulation configurations use almost identical numerical grids and are initialized with the same idealized vertical profiles of wind velocity, temperature, and moisture. The respective CBL forcings are set equal and held constant. The effects of the CBL wind shear and of the varying grid spacings are investigated. Horizontal slices of velocity fields are analyzed to enable a comparison of CBL flow patterns obtained with each simulation method. Two-dimensional velocity spectra are used to characterize the planar turbulence structure. One-dimensional velocity spectra are also calculated. Results show that the WRF model tends to attribute slightly more energy to larger-scale flow structures as compared with the CBL structures reproduced by the conventional LES. Consequently, the WRF model reproduces relatively less spatial variability of the velocity fields. Spectra from the WRF model also feature narrower inertial spectral subranges and indicate enhanced damping of turbulence on small scales.},

The methods are evaluated using high-resolution gridded numerical data from large-eddy simulations of shear-free and shear-driven convective boundary layers. Results indicate that the direct and true spectral methods are more suitable than the approximate spectral method, which overestimates the structure parameters of velocity as a result of assuming the inertial-subrange shape of the velocity spectrum for all turbulence scales. Results also suggest that structure parameters of vertical velocity fluctuations are of limited utility because of violations of local isotropy, especially in shear-free convective boundary layers.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of an Ekman layer are performed to study flow evolution during the response of an initially neutral boundary layer to stable stratification. The Obukhov length, L, is varied among cases by imposing a range of stable buoyancy fluxes at the surface to mimic ground cooling. The imposition of constant surface buoyancy flux , i.e. constant-flux stability, leads to a buoyancy difference between the ground and background that tends to increase with time, unlike the constant-temperature stability case where a constant surface temperature is imposed. The initial collapse of turbulence in the surface layer owing to surface cooling that occurs over a time scale proportional to L/u{$\ast$}, where u{$\ast$} is the friction velocity, is followed by turbulence recovery. The flow accelerates, and a ``low-level jet'' (LLJ) with inertial oscillations forms during the turbulence collapse. Turbulence statistics and budgets are examined to understand the recovery of turbulence. Vertical turbulence exchange, primarily by pressure transport, is found to initiate fluctuations in the surface layer and there is rebirth of turbulence through enhanced turbulence production as the LLJ shear increases. The turbulence recovery is not monotonic and exhibits temporal intermittency with several collapse/rebirth episodes. The boundary layer adjusts to an increase in the surface buoyancy flux by increased super-geostrophic velocity and surface stress such that the Obukhov length becomes similar among the cases and sufficiently large to allow fluctuations with sustained momentum and heat fluxes. The eventual state of fluctuations, achieved after about two inertial periods ( f t {$\approx$} 4{$\pi$}), corresponds to global intermittency with turbulent patches in an otherwise quiescent background. Our simplified configuration is sufficient to identify turbulence collapse and rebirth, global and temporal intermittency, as well as formation of low-level jets, as in observations of the stratified atmospheric boundary layer.},

  abstract = {Measurements of atmospheric turbulence made over the Arctic pack ice during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean experiment (SHEBA) are used to determine the limits of applicability of Monin--Obukhov similarity theory (in the local scaling formulation) in the stable atmospheric boundary layer. Based on the spectral analysis of wind velocity and air temperature fluctuations, it is shown that, when both the gradient Richardson number, Ri, and the flux Richardson number, Rf, exceed a `critical value' of about 0.20--0.25, the inertial subrange associated with the Richardson--Kolmogorov cascade dies out and vertical turbulent fluxes become small. Some small-scale turbulence survives even in this supercritical regime, but this is non-Kolmogorov turbulence, and it decays rapidly with further increasing stability. Similarity theory is based on the turbulent fluxes in the high-frequency part of the spectra that are associated with energy-containing/flux-carrying eddies. Spectral densities in this high-frequency band diminish as the Richardson--Kolmogorov energy cascade weakens; therefore, the applicability of local Monin--Obukhov similarity theory in stable conditions is limited by the inequalities Ri {$<$} Ricr and R f {$<$} R fcr. However, it is found that R fcr = 0.20--0.25 is a primary threshold for applicability. Applying this prerequisite shows that the data follow classical Monin--Obukhov local z-less predictions after the irrelevant cases (turbulence without the Richardson--Kolmogorov cascade) have been filtered out.},

  abstract = {Abstract For decades, stable boundary layer (SBL) turbulence has proven challenging to measure, parameterize, simulate, and interpret. Uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) are becoming a reliable method to sample the atmospheric boundary layer, offering new perspectives for understanding the SBL. Moreover, continual computational advances have enabled the use of large-eddy simulations (LES) to simulate the atmosphere at ever-smaller scales. LES is therefore a powerful tool in establishing a baseline framework to understand the extent to which vertical profiles from UAS can represent larger-scale SBL flows. To quantify the representativeness of observations from UAS profiles and eddy-covariance observations within the SBL, we performed a random error analysis using a suite of six large-eddy simulations for a wide range of stabilities. We combine these random error estimates with emulated observations of a UAS and eddy-covariance systems to better inform future observational studies. For each experiment, we estimate relative random errors using the so-called relaxed filtering method for first- and second-order moments as functions of height and averaging time. We show that the random errors can be on the same order of magnitude as other instrument-based errors due to bias or dynamic response. Unlike instrument errors, however, random errors decrease with averaging time. For these reasons, we recommend coupling UAS observations with other ground-based instruments as well as dynamically adjusting the UAS vertical ascent rate to account for how errors change with height and stability. Significance Statement Weather-sensing uncrewed aircraft systems are rapidly being realized as effective tools to collect valuable observations within the atmospheric boundary layer. To fully capitalize on this novel observational technique, it is necessary to develop an understanding of how well their observations can represent the surrounding atmosphere across various spatial and temporal scales. In this study we quantify the representativeness of atmospheric observations in the stable boundary layer by evaluating the random errors for parameters such as temperature, wind speed, and fluxes as estimated from a suite of large-eddy simulations. Our results can better inform future studies utilizing uncrewed aircraft systems by highlighting how random errors in their observations relate to vertical ascent rate, atmospheric stability, and measurement height.},

In such applications, coarse-grained simulation (CGS) becomes the effective simulation strategy, mostly by necessity rather than by choice. In CGS strategies, resolved/unresolved scale separation is assumed possible, large energy-containing structures are mostly resolved, smaller structures are spatially filtered out and unresolved subgrid effects are modeled; this includes classical large-eddy simulation (LES) strategies with the explicit use of closure subgrid scale models and implicit LES, relying on subgrid modeling implicitly provided by physics-capturing numerical algorithms. Predictability issues in CGS of under-resolved mixing of material scalars driven by under-resolved velocity fields and initial conditions are addressed in this paper, and shock-driven turbulent mixing is a particular focus.},

The paper is based on model simulations of three experimental data sets reported in the literature. The Hanford data set covered weakly stable conditions, the Prairie Grass experiments covered both weakly stable and very stable atmospheric conditions, and the Lillestr{\o}m experiment was carried out during very stable conditions. Simulations of these experiments reported in the literature for eight different models are discussed. Applied models based on the Gaussian plume model concept with the spread parameters described in terms of the Pasquill stability classification or Monin--Obukhov similarity relationships are used. Other model types are Lagrangian particle models which also are parameterized in terms of Monin--Obukhov similarity relationships. The applied models describe adequately the dispersion process in a weakly stable atmosphere, but fail during very stable atmospheric conditions. This suggests that Monin--Obukhov similarity theory is an adequate tool for the parameterization of the input parameters to atmospheric dispersion models during weakly stable conditions, but that more detailed parameterisations including other physical processes than those covered by the Monin--Obukhov theory should be developed for the very stable atmosphere.},

At higher levels deviations from the measurements progressively occur. For applied use an extension to the wind profile in the surface layer is formulated for the entire boundary layer, with emphasis on the lowest 200--300 m and considering only wind speeds above 3 m s-1 at 10 m height. The friction velocity is taken to decrease linearly through the boundary layer. The wind profile length scale is composed of three component length scales. In the surface layer the first length scale is taken to increase linearly with height with a stability correction following Monin-Obukhov similarity. Above the surface layer the second length scale (LMBL) becomes independent of height but not of stability, and at the top of the boundary layer the third length scale is assumed to be negligible. A simple model for the combined length scale that controls the wind profile and its stability dependence is formulated by inverse summation. Based on these assumptions the wind profile for the entire boundary layer is derived. A parameterization of LMBL is formulated using the geostrophic drag law, which relates friction velocity and geostrophic wind. The empirical parameterization of the resistance law functions A and B in the geostrophic drag law is uncertain, making it impractical. Therefore an expression for the length scale, LMBL, for applied use is suggested, based on measurements from the two sites.},

By changing the sea ice distribution in our LES, we were able to simulate a roll and a nonroll case for each scenario. Furthermore, the roll wavelength was varied by changing the scale of the heterogeneity. The characteristics of the simulated rolls and cloud streets, such as aspect ratios, orientation of the roll axes, and downstream extensions of single rolls agreed closely with observations in CAO situations. The vertical turbulent fluxes, calculated for each simulation, were decomposed into contributions from rolls and from unorganized turbulence. Even though our results confirmed that rolls triggered by upstream heterogeneities can substantially contribute to vertical turbulent fluxes, the total fluxes were not affected by the rolls.},

  abstract = {An adaptive algorithm based on wavelets is proposed for the efficient numerical solution of a control problem governed by a linear parabolic evolution equation. First, the constraints are represented by means of a full weak space-time formulation as a linear system in 2 in wavelet coordinates, following a recent approach by Schwab and Stevenson. Second, a quadratic cost functional involving a tracking-type term for the state and a regularization term for the distributed control is also formulated in terms of 2 sequence norms of wavelet coordinates. This functional serves as a representer for a functional involving different Sobolev norms with possibly nonintegral smoothness parameter. Standard techniques from optimization are then used to derive the first order necessary conditions as a coupled system in 2-coordinates. For this purpose, an adaptive method is proposed, which can be interpreted as an inexact gradient method for the control. In each iteration step, the primal and adjoint systems are solved up to a prescribed accuracy by the adaptive algorithm. It is shown that the adaptive algorithm converges. Moreover, the algorithm is proved to be asymptotically optimal: the convergence rate achieved for computing each of the components of the solution (state, adjoint state, and control) up to a desired target tolerance is asymptotically the same as the wavelet best N -term approximation of each solution component, and the total computational work is proportional to the number of computational unknowns.},

The sensitivity of radiative cooling to structure of the atmosphere near the surface is first examined in terms of artificial profiles. In general, the radiative cooling is proportional to the negative curvature of the temperature profile, magnitude of the specific humidity and the deficit of the ground surface temperature. For the days examined, the radiative flux divergence appears to control the initial formation of the surface inversion at the beginning of the night when the turbulence collapses.},

The coherency between stations is examined in terms of the between-station correlations of the wind components for all pairs of stations as a function of separation distance between stations. A mesovelocity scale is defined as a measure of the spatial variability of the wind field within the network. This variability is related to wind speed and cloud cover for the two contrasting regional networks. Additional comparisons are made with a homogenous rural network in Iowa. The results underscore the complexity of flow with topography, urban areas, and land--sea contrasts and demonstrate the inadequacy of existing network strategies.},

This approach is modified in this study to include ``z-less'' turbulence, which is formulated in terms of a stability-dependent mixing length and a Prandtl number, which are not tied to the existence of a boundary layer depth. These modifications have been guided by analysis of nocturnal boundary layer data from the Cooperative Atmospheric-Surface Exchange Study--1999. The modeled turbulence sometimes exhibits an upside-down structure with turbulence generated by shear associated with nocturnal flow acceleration at higher levels. The modified model produces a more realistic smoother wind speed maximum (nocturnal jet) and generates layers of turbulence above the boundary layer. Remaining shortcomings of the new model are discussed.},

Although the stability parameter, z /L, is inversely dependent on the mean wind speed, the speed of the large-scale flow includes independent influences on the flux--gradient relationship. The dimensionless mean wind shear is found to obey existing stability functions when z /L is less than unity, particularly for the strong and intermediate wind classes. For weak mean winds and/or strong stability (z /L Ͼ 1), this similarity theory breaks down. Deviations from similarity theory are examined in terms of intermittency.

Yet, there is a lack of robust numerical models investigating the impact of these parameters. In this study two-dimensional CFD simulations of an isolated VAWT and of co- and counter-rotating pairs of VAWTs were performed with the aim to determine turbine layouts that can increase the power output of VAWT farms. More than 11,500~h of simulations were conducted at a turbine diameter Reynolds number of 1.35 {$\cdot$} 107. A mesh convergence study was conducted, investigating the influence of mesh size, domain size, azimuth increment, number of iterations per time step, and domain cell density. Results showed that mesh size, domain size, and azimuth increment proved to have the biggest impact on the converged results. For the configurations analysed, pairs of VAWTs exhibited a 15\% increase in power output compared to operating in isolation, when the second rotor was spaced three turbine diameters downstream and at an angle of 60{$^\circ$} to the wind direction. Furthermore, when three turbines were positioned in series, the power output was greater than a pair by an additional 3\%.},

  abstract = {Global intermittency is observed in the stably stratified Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) and corresponds to having large nonturbulent flow regions to develop in an otherwise turbulent flow. In this paper, the differences between continuous and intermittent turbulence are quantified with the help of coherent structures. Eight classes of coherent structures are identified from literature, most of which are indicated by scalar criteria derived from velocity fields. A method is developed to geometrically classify structures into three categories: blob-like, tube-like or sheet-like. An alternate definition of the intermittency factor \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ based on coherent structures is introduced to separate turbulent and nonturbulent parts of a flow. Applying this conditioning technique and the geometrical characterization on direct numerical simulations (DNS) of an Ekman flow, we find the following: (i) structures with similar geometries (either tube-like or sheet-like) are found regardless of the strength of stratification; (ii) global intermittency affects all regions of the ABL - viscous sublayer, buffer layer, inner, and outer layer; (iii) for the highly stratified case, sweep/ejection pairs form well-separated clusters within the viscous sublayer which can possibly explain the abundance of hairpin-like vortices with a particular orientation; (iv) nonturbulent regions are occupied with streamwise velocity fluctuations and there is a switch between high- and low-speed streaks at a particular height for all stratified cases.},

Deterministic models with realistic spatial resolution can cover only a relatively small band of the total spectrum. Thus a sequence of models is needed for different time-scale ranges, and strategies for coupling together models for different time scales must be devised. A simple example shows that climatic response experiments carried out with models designed only for a single time-scale range (for example an atmospheric GCM) can be quite misleading. A technique for coupling models in which the natural time scales are separated by a spectral gap is described. The theory yields natural climatic variance spectra of approximately the right shape and order of magnitude and provides a basis for designing climatic response experiments with proper consideration of the signal-to-noise problem.},

  abstract = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slowchangesof climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period ``weather'' disturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying ``weather'' system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding ``climate'' system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged ``weather'' components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts ``red'' variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.},

Owing to its highly accurate representation of small-scale turbulence structures, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is shown to be the most effective numerical approach for strongly stratified flows. However, due to the limitation of the traditional parallel strategy, existing DNS studies on stratified channel flows are limited to relatively low Reynolds numbers. In order to make the DNS studies more relevant to the atmospheric boundary layer flows, in this paper, a high-order finite-difference DNS solver is developed for simulating stably stratified turbulent channel flows at relatively high Reynolds numbers. Utilizing the advanced two dimensional domain decomposition technique, the DNS solver is shown to be competent for petascale simulations with excellent scalability tested up to 32,768 CPU cores. Using this newly developed solver, two stably stratified open-channel simulations are conducted with the highest Reynolds number being approximately 105. The fundamental characteristics of strongly stratified turbulent flows, e.g., spatio-temporal variation of global intermittency, are compared with those previously reported at relatively low Reynolds numbers, and their similarities and discrepancies are also discussed. In addition, the DNS-based Monin--Obukhov similarity relationships are compared with those proposed based on observational data to evaluate their relevance to atmospheric flows.

Conditional averages are used to generate mean and fluctuating components for the turbulent and non-turbulent zones of fluid. More particularly, point averages of these variables, taken with reference to the instantaneous position of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, have been made to show the distribution of various quantities through the turbulent front. The results indicate that significant differences exist at leading and trailing edges of the turbulent bursts and a more complete picture of the motion of an average large eddy is deduced.},

These responses include the decrease in convective mass fluxes, the increase in horizontal moisture transport, the associated enhancement of the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation and its temporal variance, and the decrease in the horizontal sensible heat transport in the extratropics. A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios. All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor.},

  abstract = {Some time ago, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) was proposed as a new verification tool for (probabilistic) forecast systems. Its focus is on the entire permissible range of a certain (weather) parameter. The CRPS can be seen as a ranked probability score with an infinite number of classes, each of zero width. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as the integral of the Brier score over all possible threshold values for the parameter under consideration. For a deterministic forecast system the CRPS reduces to the mean absolute error. In this paper it is shown that for an ensemble prediction system the CRPS can be decomposed into a reliability part and a resolution/uncertainty part, in a way that is similar to the decomposition of the Brier score. The reliability part of the CRPS is closely connected to the rank histogram of the ensemble, while the resolution/ uncertainty part can be related to the average spread within the ensemble and the behavior of its outliers. The usefulness of such a decomposition is illustrated for the ensemble prediction system running at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The evaluation of the CRPS and its decomposition proposed in this paper can be extended to systems issuing continuous probability forecasts, by realizing that these can be interpreted as the limit of ensemble forecasts with an infinite number of members.},

The resulting entropy spectrum allows the assessment of the amount of information on different scales. The wavelet transformation and the most frequent-value method are used as filters for the decomposition. We also derive an analytical formula for estimation of the probability density function (PDF) of filtered random surface parameters using the most frequent-value method. By analyzing the entropy spectrum of synthetic data, we derive rules for the interpretation of the entropy spectrum. We then apply them to real data and appraise, which scale of the heterogeneity is important for land surface and atmosphere interactions.},

While general agreement exists that Monin--Obukhov similarity is not applicable in the stable boundary layer (SBL) due to the nonhomogeneous, nonstationary flow, no universal organizing theory for the surface SBL has been presented. The Stable Atmospheric Variability and Transport (SAVANT) field campaign took place in the fall of 2018 to explore under what conditions shallow drainage flow is generated. The campaign took place in an agricultural setting and covered the period of both pre- and postharvest, allowing for not only a basic exploration of the boundary layer but also a robust dataset for applied agricultural understanding of aerosol dispersion and impacts of changes in surface cover on drainage flows. This article provides a description of the field campaign. Examples of publicly available data products are presented, as well as examples of shallow drainage flow and corresponding lidar measurements of dispersion. Additionally, the field campaign was used to provide educational opportunities for students from several disciplines, and the outcomes of these joint educational ventures are discussed as models for future collaborations.},

The techniques used are three-dimensional particle tracking (3D-PTV), allowing the field of velocity derivatives to be measured and followed in a Lagrangian manner, and direct numerical simulations (DNS). In both experiment and simulation the Taylor-microscale Reynolds number is               Re               {$\lambda$}               = 50. The results are based on the Lagrangian viewpoint with the main focus on flow particle tracers crossing the turbulent/non-turbulent interface. This approach allowed a direct investigation of the key physical processes underlying the entrainment phenomenon and revealed the role of small-scale non-local, inviscid and viscous processes. We found that the entrainment mechanism is initiated by self-amplification of               s               2               through the combined effect of strain production and pressure--strain interaction. This process is followed by a sharp change of {$\omega$}               2               induced mostly by production due to viscous effects. The influence of inviscid production is initially small but gradually increasing, whereas viscous production changes abruptly towards the destruction of {$\omega$}               2               . Finally, shortly after the crossing of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, production and dissipation of both enstrophy and strain reach a balance. The characteristic time scale of the described processes is the Kolmogorov time scale, {$\tau$}               {$\eta$}               . Locally, the characteristic velocity of the fluid relative to the turbulent/non-turbulent interface is the Kolmogorov velocity,               u               {$\eta$}               .},

  abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of flow properties in the proximity of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface (TNTI), with particular focus on the acceleration of fluid particles, pressure and related small scale quantities such as enstrophy,               {$\omega$}               2               =                                {$\omega$}                 i                 {$\omega$}                 i                              , and strain,               s               2               =                                s                 ij                                               s                 ij                              . The emphasis is on the qualitative differences between turbulent, intermediate and non-turbulent flow regions, emanating from the solenoidal nature of the turbulent region, the irrotational character of the non-turbulent region and the mixed nature of the intermediate region in between. The results are obtained from a particle tracking experiment and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a temporally developing flow without mean shear. The analysis reveals that turbulence influences its neighbouring ambient flow in three different ways depending on the distance to the TNTI: (i) pressure has the longest range of influence into the ambient region and in the far region non-local effects dominate. This is felt on the level of velocity as irrotational fluctuations, on the level of acceleration as local change of velocity due to pressure gradients, D                                u                              /D               t               {$\simeq$} {$\partial$}                                u                              /{$\partial$}               t               {$\simeq$} -∇               p               /{$\rho$}, and, finally, on the level of strain due to pressure-Hessian/strain interaction, (D/D               t               )(               s               2               /2) {$\simeq$} ({$\partial$}/{$\partial$}               t               )(               s               2               /2) {$\simeq$} -                                s                 ij                 p                              ,                                ij                              {$>$} 0; (ii) at intermediate distances convective terms (both for acceleration and strain) as well as strain production -                                s                 ij                 s                 jk                 s                 ki                              {$>$} 0 start to set in.

Convective terms show a positive peak reflecting previous findings that in the laboratory frame of reference the interface moves locally with a velocity comparable to the fluid velocity fluctuations.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a revised vertical diffusion package with a nonlocal turbulent mixing coefficient in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Based on the study of Noh et al. and accumulated results of the behavior of the Hong and Pan algorithm, a revised vertical diffusion algorithm that is suitable for weather forecasting and climate prediction models is developed. The major ingredient of the revision is the inclusion of an explicit treatment of entrainment processes at the top of the PBL. The new diffusion package is called the Yonsei University PBL (YSU PBL). In a one-dimensional offline test framework, the revised scheme is found to improve several features compared with the Hong and Pan implementation. The YSU PBL increases boundary layer mixing in the thermally induced free convection regime and decreases it in the mechanically induced forced convection regime, which alleviates the well-known problems in the MediumRange Forecast (MRF) PBL. Excessive mixing in the mixed layer in the presence of strong winds is resolved. Overly rapid growth of the PBL in the case of the Hong and Pan is also rectified. The scheme has been successfully implemented in the Weather Research and Forecast model producing a more realistic structure of the PBL and its development. In a case study of a frontal tornado outbreak, it is found that some systematic biases of the large-scale features such as an afternoon cold bias at 850 hPa in the MRF PBL are resolved. Consequently, the new scheme does a better job in reproducing the convective inhibition. Because the convective inhibition is accurately predicted, widespread light precipitation ahead of a front, in the case of the MRF PBL, is reduced. In the frontal region, the YSU PBL scheme improves some characteristics, such as a double line of intense convection. This is because the boundary layer from the YSU PBL scheme remains less diluted by entrainment leaving more fuel for severe convection when the front triggers it.},

  abstract = {The turbulence generated by wind shear is described at grey-zone resolutions using a theoretical neutral boundary layer based on atmospheric conditions constructed from measurements from the CASES-99 field campaign. Six-metre-resolution large-eddy simulations (LES) are performed to access the ``true'' resolved turbulence for two cases, corresponding to a forcing of the boundary layer by zonal geostrophic wind speeds of 10 m s-1 and 20 m s-1. The LES fields are subject to a coarse-graining procedure in order to compute turbulence diagnostics in the grey zone, with the robustness and weakness of various averaging procedures tested, for which simple top-hat averaging is found to be both suitable and accurate. In addition, the ``true'' resolved and subgrid-scale fluxes, variances, turbulent kinetic energy and production terms are quantified on various scales. The grey zone of turbulence is defined as the range of scales where 10--90\% of turbulence is resolved, which here ranges from resolutions of 25--800 m (0.03 {$<$} x/h {$<$} 1, where x is the horizontal resolution, and h is the boundarylayer height). The subgrid/resolved partitioning of the variances of the velocity components depends on the geostrophic wind speed, which is not the case for the momentum-flux partitioning. Dynamic production terms show that fine-scale turbulence is isotropic ( x/h {$<$} 0.03) and is quasi one-directional, oriented in the direction of the geostrophic wind vector at the mesoscale ( x/h {$>$} 1). The turbulence parametrizations, which are tested in the M{\'e}so-NH model by running simulations at resolutions from the LES scale to the mesoscale, fail to produce the correct turbulence regardless of resolution.},

  abstract = {A numerical framework for data-based identification of nonstationary linear factor models is presented. The approach is based on the extension of the recently developed method for identification of persistent dynamical phases in multidimensional time series, permitting the identification of discontinuous temporal changes in underlying model parameters. The finite element method (FEM) discretization of the resulting variational functional is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting problem and to construct the numerical iterative algorithm. The presented method results in the sparse sequential linear minimization problem with linear constrains. The performance of the framework is demonstrated for the following two application examples: (i) in the context of subgrid-scale parameterization for the Lorenz model with external forcing and (ii) in an analysis of climate impact factors acting on the blocking events in the upper troposphere. The importance of accounting for the nonstationarity issue is demonstrated in the second application example: modeling the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) geopotential time series via a single best stochastic model with time-independent coefficients leads to the conclusion that all of the considered external factors are found to be statistically insignificant, whereas considering the nonstationary model (which is demonstrated to be more appropriate in the sense of information theory) identified by the methodology presented in the paper results in identification of statistically significant external impact factor influences.},

  abstract = {The two main principles underlying the use of isentropic maps of potential vorticity to represent dynamical processes in the atmosphere are reviewed, including the extension of those principles to take the lower boundary condition into account. The first is the familiar Lagrangian conservation principle, for potential vorticity (PV) and potential temperature, which holds approximately when advective processes dominate frictional and diabatic ones. The second is the principle of `invertibility' of the PV distribution, which holds whether or not diabatic and frictional processes are important. The invertibility principle states that if the total mass under each isentropic surface is specified, then a knowledge of the global distribution of PV on each isentropic surface and of potential temperature at the lower boundary (which within certain limitations can be considered to be part of the PV distribution) is sufficient to deduce, diagnostically, all the other dynamical fields, such as winds, temperatures, geopotential heights, static stabilities, and vertical velocities, under a suitable balance condition. The statement that vertical velocities can be deduced is related to the well-known omega equation principle, and depends on having sufficient information about diabatic and frictional processes. Quasi-geostrophic, semigeostrophic, and `nonlinear normal mode initialization' realizations of the balance condition are discussed. An important constraint on the mass-weighted integral of PV over a material volume and on its possible diabatic and frictional change is noted.},

The objective of this work is to extract the part of the flow that can be described by the AEH, and study the statistical behaviours of the other part, which cannot be described by the AEH. In this process, two types of eddies are identified in addition to the Kolmogorov-scale eddies, i.e. wall-attached eddies and wall-detached eddies. The statistical behaviours of the wall-attached eddies are shown to be very well described by the AEH, i.e. the eddies are wall-attached, self-similar and, importantly, Gaussian, whereas the wall-detached eddies cannot be modelled by the AEH. Specifically, a decomposition scheme is proposed following Townsend (The Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow, Cambridge University Press, 1976). We apply our decomposition scheme to three different flows, i.e. channel, boundary layer and atmospheric surface layer flows. The results are similar with only quantitative differences, suggesting possible universality in both the wall-attached eddies and the wall-detached eddies.},

Here we present a new statistical-physics-like approach whereby the spatial autocorrelation function can be used to physically capture the net effects of subgrid cloud interaction with radiation. The new approach is able to faithfully reproduce the Monte Carlo 3D simulation results with several orders less computational cost, allowing for more realistic representation of cloud radiation interactions in large-scale models.},

  abstract = {This study seeks to quantitatively and qualitatively understand how stability affects transport in the continuously turbulent stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer, based on a suite of large-eddy simulations. The test cases are based on the one adopted by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS) project, but with a largely expanded stability range where the gradient Richardson number (Rig) reaches up to around 1. The analysis is mainly focused on understanding the modification of turbulent structures and dynamics with increasing stability in order to improve the modeling of the stable atmospheric boundary layer in weather and climate models, a topic addressed in Part II of this work. It is found that at quasi equilibrium, an increase in stability results in stronger vertical gradients of the mean temperature, a lowered low-level jet, a decrease in vertical momentum transport, an increase in vertical buoyancy flux, and a shallower boundary layer. Analysis of coherent turbulent structures using two-point autocorrelation reveals that the autocorrelation of the streamwise velocity is horizontally anisotropic while the autocorrelation of the vertical velocity is relatively isotropic in the horizontal plane and its integral length scale decreases as stability increases. The effects of stability on the overall turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and its budget terms are also investigated, and it is shown that the authors' large-eddy simulation results are in good agreement with previous experimental findings across varied stabilities. Finally, Nieuwstadt's local-scaling theory is reexamined and it is concluded that the height z is not a relevant scaling parameter and should be replaced by a constant length scale away from the surface, indicating that the z-less range starts lower than previously assumed.},

  abstract = {This is the second part of a study about turbulence and vertical fluxes in the stable atmospheric boundary layer. Based on a suite of large-eddy simulations in Part I where the effects of stability on the turbulent structures and kinetic energy are investigated, first-order parameterization schemes are assessed and tested in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)'s single-column model. The applicability of the gradient-flux hypothesis is first examined and it is found that stable conditions are favorable for that hypothesis. However, the concept of introducing a stability correction function fm as a multiplicative factor into the mixing length used under neutral conditions lN is shown to be problematic because fm computed a priori from large-eddy simulations tends not to be a universal function of stability. With this observation, a novel mixing-length model is proposed, which conforms to large-eddy simulation results much better under stable conditions and converges to the classic model under neutral conditions. Test cases imposing steady as well as unsteady forcings are developed to evaluate the performance of the new model. It is found that the new model exhibits robust performance as the stability strength is changed, while other models are sensitive to changes in stability. For cases with unsteady forcings, which are very rarely simulated or tested, the results of the singlecolumn model and large-eddy simulations are also closer when the new model is used, compared to the other models. However, unsteady cases are much more challenging for the turbulence closure formulations than cases with steady surface forcing.},

Moreover, the components allow for a definition of instantaneous frequencies through complexifying each component by means of the application of the Hilbert transform.

  abstract = {A new wall shear stress model to be used as a wall boundary condition for large-eddy simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer is proposed. The new model computes the wall shear stress and the vertical derivatives of the streamwise velocity component by means of a modified, instantaneous, and local law-of-thewall formulation. By formulating a correction for the modeled shear stress, using experimental findings of a logarithmic region in the streamwise turbulent fluctuations, the need for a filter is eliminated. This allows one to model the wall shear stress locally, and at the same time accurately recover the correct average value. The proposed model has been applied to both unique high Reynolds number experimental data and a suite of large-eddy simulations, and compared to previous models. It is shown that the proposed model performs equally well or better than the previous filtered models. A nonfiltered model, such as the one proposed, is an essential first step in developing a universal wall shear stress model that can be used for flow over heterogeneous surfaces, studies of diurnal cycles, or analyses of flow over complex terrain.},

  abstract = {A prognostic three-dimensional mesoscale model has been developed and used in one- and two-dimensional modes to evaluate ten local turbulence closure schemes. The schemes ranged from first-order to the two-equation prognostic schemes. Predictions by the models were compared for a one-dimensional convective boundary layer using mixed layer scaling and measurements to interpret the results. Two-dimensional simulations were also performed for a sea-breeze flow and for flow over a hill. The results showed that for all of the models considered, minor differences were produced in the mean meteorological fields and in the vertical scalar fluxes, but major differences were apparent in the velocity variances and dissipation rate. Predicted tracer concentrations were very sensitive to the turbulence model formulation for dispersion from a point source in the convective boundary layer, particularly for the prediction of maximum concentrations. Predicted tracer concentrations from a surface volume source for the two-dimensional simulations were similar for all models, although the degree of mixing in the morning growth period produced some differences. Generally, good results for the mean meteorological fields can be obtained with first-order schemes, even if they underpredict the magnitude of turbulence in the convective boundary layer, and reasonable tracer concentrations can also be obtained with these models provided near-source effects are not important. The two-equation prognostic models performed best for the prediction of turbulence in the convective boundary layer.},

  abstract = {Integrated hydrologic models coupled to land surface models require several input parameters to characterize the land surface and to estimate energy fluxes. Uncertainty of input parameter values is inherent in any model and the sensitivity of output to these uncertain parameters becomes an important consideration. To better understand these connections in the context of hydrologic models, we use the ParFlow-Common Land Model (PF-CLM) to estimate energy fluxes given variations in 19 vegetation and land surface parameters over a 144-hour period of time. Latent, sensible and ground heat fluxes from bare soil and grass vegetation were estimated using single column and tilted-v domains. Energy flux outputs, along with the corresponding input parameters, from each of the four scenario simulations were evaluated using active subspaces. The active subspace method considers parameter sensitivity by quantifying a weight for each parameter. The method also evaluates the potential for dimension reduction by identifying the input--output relationship through the active variable -- a linear combination of input parameters. The aerodynamic roughness length was the most important parameter for bare soil energy fluxes. Multiple parameters were important for energy fluxes from vegetated surfaces and depended on the type of energy flux. Relationships between land surface inputs and output fluxes varied between latent, sensible and ground heat, but were consistent between domain setup (i.e., with or without lateral flow) and vegetation type. A quadratic polynomial was used to describe the input--output relationship for these energy fluxes. The reduced-dimension model of land surface dynamics can be compared to observations or used to solve the inverse problem. Considering this work as a proof-ofconcept, the active subspace method can be applied and extended to a range of domain setups, land cover types and time periods to obtain a reduced-form representation of any output of interest, provided that an active subspace exists.},

Individual clouds are tracked over the course of their lifetimes. Precipitation rate decreases progressively as aerosol increases. For larger, precipitating clouds, the polluted clouds have longer lifetimes because of precipitation suppression. For clean aerosol conditions, there is good agreement between the average model precipitation rate and that calculated based on observed radar reflectivity Z and precipitation rate R relationships. Precipitation rate can be expressed as a power-law function of liquid water path (LWP) and Nd, to reasonable accuracy. The respective powers for LWP and Nd are of similar magnitude compared to those based on observational studies of stratocumulus clouds. The timeintegrated precipitation rate represented by a power-law function of LWP, Nd, and cloud lifetime is much more reliably predicted than is R expressed in terms of LWP and Nd alone. The precipitation susceptibility (So 5 2dlnR/dlnNd) that quantifies the sensitivity of precipitation to changes in Nd depends strongly on LWP and exhibits nonmonotonic behavior with a maximum at intermediate LWP values. The relationship between So and precipitation efficiency is explored and the importance of including dependence on Nd in the latter is highlighted. The results provide trade cumulus cloud population statistics, as well as relationships between microphysical/macrophysical properties and precipitation, that are amenable for use in larger-scale models.},

Immediately above the surface log-law layer, a second log-law layer has been identified from these simulations. The depth of this upper log-law layer is comparable to its counterpart in the surface layer, and the wind speed can be scaled as u*(u*/fh)3/4, as opposed to just u* in the surface log-law layer, implying that in addition to surface processes, the upper log-law layer is also influenced by Earth's rotation and large-scale conditions. Here u* is the friction velocity at the surface, and h is the boundary layer depth. An analytical model is proposed to assist in the interpretation of the log laws in a typical Ekman boundary layer. The physics and implications of the upper log-law layer are discussed.},

  abstract = {The kinematics and dynamics of wall-bounded turbulence are surveyed, with emphasis on the multiscale processes associated with the logarithmic layer and with its interactions with the wall. It is shown that the logarithmic law reflects a momentum cascade and that its structure agrees reasonably well with Townsend\&apos;s (1961) model of a self-similar family of attached eddies, each of which contains, on average, a sweep-ejection pair, a segment of a large velocity streak, and disorganized vorticity. Those logarithmic eddies are themselves turbulent objects and can be studied in minimal simulation boxes that are much larger than those in the buffer layer. It is argued that, near the wall, the logarithmic eddies are probably the same as the vortex packets identified by experiments, but that their dynamics does not appear to be especially linked to the buffer layer. Further from the wall, they align into longer superstreaks, although the mechanism remains unclear.},

In this work, a LES model is used to determine what range of stable stratification can still be simulated with a subgrid turbulence scheme using the Kolmogorov theory for the dissipation. Twenty simulations of increasing stability have been performed using a horizontal resolution of 5 m. The model is able to simulate weakly and moderately stable conditions and experiences runaway cooling for strong stability. The goodness of the successful simulations is inspected through comparison to observations from the experimental campaigns SABLES-98 and CASES-99.

It involves the  formation of velocity streaks from the advection of the mean profile by streamwise  vortices, and the generation of the vortices from the instability of the streaks.

Comparisons are made with experimental data at higher Reynolds numbers. It is found, in agreement with previous investigations, that the intensity profiles of the streamwise and spanwise velocity components have logarithmic ranges that are traced to the widening spectral range of scales as the wall is approached. The same is true for the pressure, both theoretically and observationally, but not for the normal velocity or for the tangential stress cospectrum, although even those two quantities have structures with lengths of the order of several hundred times the wall distance. Because the logarithmic range grows longer as the Reynolds number increases, variables which are `attached' in this sense scale in the buffer layer in mixed units. These results give strong support to the attached-eddy scenario proposed by Townsend (1976), but they are not linked to any particular eddy model. The scaling of the outer modes is also examined. The intensity of the streamwise velocity at fixed               y               /               h               increases with the Reynolds number. This is traced to the large-scale modes, and to an increased intensity of the ejections but not of the sweeps. Several differences are found between the outer structures of different flows. The outer modes of the spanwise and wall-normal velocities in boundary layers are stronger than in internal flows, and their streamwise velocities penetrate closer to the wall. As a consequence, their logarithmic layers are thinner, and some of their logarithmic slopes are different.

  abstract = {Flows in which shock waves and turbulence are present and interact dynamically occur in a wide range of applications, including inertial confinement fusion, supernovae explosion, and scramjet propulsion. Accurate simulations of such problems are challenging because of the contradictory requirements of numerical methods used to simulate turbulence, which must minimize any numerical dissipation that would otherwise overwhelm the small scales, and shock-capturing schemes, which introduce numerical dissipation to stabilize the solution. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the performance of several numerical methods capable of simultaneously handling turbulence and shock waves. A comprehensive range of high-resolution methods (WENO, hybrid WENO/central difference, artificial diffusivity, adaptive characteristic-based filter, and shock fitting) and suite of test cases (Taylor--Green vortex, Shu--Osher problem, shock-vorticity/entropy wave interaction, Noh problem, compressible isotropic turbulence) relevant to problems with shocks and turbulence are considered. The results indicate that the WENO methods provide sharp shock profiles, but overwhelm the physical dissipation. The hybrid method is minimally dissipative and leads to sharp shocks and well-resolved broadband turbulence, but relies on an appropriate shock sensor. Artificial diffusivity methods in which the artificial bulk viscosity is based on the magnitude of the strain-rate tensor resolve vortical structures well but damp dilatational modes in compressible turbulence; dilatation-based artificial bulk viscosity methods significantly improve this behavior. For well-defined shocks, the shock fitting approach yields good results. {\'O} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A significant number of tropical cyclones move into the midlatitudes and transform into extratropical cyclones. This process is generally referred to as extratropical transition (ET). During ET a cyclone frequently produces intense rainfall and strong winds and has increased forward motion, so that such systems pose a serious threat to land and maritime activities. Changes in the structure of a system as it evolves from a tropical to an extratropical cyclone during ET necessitate changes in forecast strategies. In this paper a brief climatology of ET is given and the challenges associated with forecasting extratropical transition are described in terms of the forecast variables (track, intensity, surface winds, precipitation) and their impacts (flooding, bush fires, ocean response). The problems associated with the numerical prediction of ET are discussed. A comprehensive review of the current understanding of the processes involved in ET is presented. Classifications of extratropical transition are described and potential vorticity thinking is presented as an aid to understanding ET. Further sections discuss the interaction between a tropical cyclone and the midlatitude environment, the role of latent heat release, convection and the underlying surface in ET, the structural changes due to frontogenesis, the mechanisms responsible for precipitation, and the energy budget during ET. Finally, a summary of the future directions for research into ET is given.},

  abstract = {Time series is the major source of information to study characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), which is frequently dominated by various types of events embedded in the time series with different levels of noise. To understand physical dynamics of the atmospheric turbulence, the individual events need to be detected and studied about their physical and structural characteristics. In spite of the attention that has been given to studying events among the atmospheric sci- ence community, the detection of events still presents a challenge, and thus their characteristics and contributions to the ABL remain poorly understood. Besides the existence of high level noise in turbulence, the main diculty is that many of the events that are responsible for the variability in the atmospheric turbulence time series are previously unknown, especially in the stable ABL. This dissertation develops a new method for detecting and classifying structures from turbulence time series. The main idea of the method is in defining events as time-series subsequences that are significantly different from noise. This switches the focus of the event detection approach towards defining the characteristics of noise, which is in many situations an easier problem than defining a structure. For atmospheric time series, a natural characterization of the noise is red noise, which is a stationary AR(1) process. The proposed method consists of two steps. The first step of the method is event extraction based on noise tests. We perform a noise test on each subsequence extracted from the series using a sliding window. All the subsequences recognized as noise are removed from further analysis, and the events are extracted from the remaining non-noise subsequences. This step does not assume particular geometries or amplitudes of the flow structures. In the second step, the detected structures are classified into groups with similar characteristics. This step groups large numbers of detected events such that it opens a pathway for the detailed study of their characteristics, and helps to gain understanding of events with previously unknown origin. In order to account for the underlying characteristics of the extracted events, a feature-based clustering method is used, which first summarizes each event with its global measures before performing clustering in the feature space. It yields substantially better results than clustering based on raw data of the events. The developed R package TED is tested on artificial time series with different levels of complexity and real world atmospheric turbulence time series. The results on artificial data show that events used to generate the data can be exactly detected and clustered. The method is robust to high levels of noise, which is advantageous regarding very noisy turbulence time series. Application of the method to a well- known real world turbulence dataset demonstrates that the method successfully extracts realistic flow structures, which are in line with previous studies that have examined the underlying physical mechanisms of several isolated events on that dataset. From the application of the method to a more complicated turbulence dataset, about which no published results can be found regarding extraction of unknown events, the proposed method is able to detect and distinguish events with different dynamical characteristics even though the clustering step is only based on statistical measures of characteristics of events from time series.},

  abstract = {This article analyses ubiquitous flow structures which affect the dynamics of stable atmospheric boundary layers. These structures introduce non-stationarity and intermittency to turbulent mixing, thus invalidating the usual scaling laws and numerical model parametrizations, but their characteristics and generating mechanisms are still generally unknown. Detecting these unknown events from time series requires techniques that do not assume particular geometries or amplitudes of the flow structures. We use a recently developed such method with some modifications to study the night-time structures over a three-month period during the FLOSSII experiment. The structures cover about 26\% of the dataset, and can be categorized using clustering into only three classes with similar characteristics. The largest class, including about 50\% of the events, contains smooth structures, often with wave-like shapes, which occur in stronger winds and weak stability. The second class, including sharper structures with large kurtosis, is characterized by weaker winds and stronger stability. The smallest class, including about 20\% of the events, contains predominantly sharp step-like structures, or microfronts. They occur in the weakest winds with strong stability. Sharper, and particularly shallower, structures are related to transient low-level wind maxima which create inflection points and may affect generation of turbulence. Furthermore, large wind directional shear, which is another source of transient inflection points, is generated even by deep coherent structures when the background wind is weaker than the structure intensity. These results show that the complexity of structures can be reduced for the purpose of further analysis using a proper classification. Mapping common characteristics of such events leads to their better understanding, which, if combined with similar analyses of other boundary-layer data, could lead to improving their effects in numerical models.},

Using cluster expansion techniques we expand the exact coarse-grained Hamiltonian around a first approximation and derive higher accuracy schemes by including more terms in the expansion. The accuracy of the coarse-graining schemes is measured in terms of information loss, i.e., relative entropy, between the exact and approximate coarse-grained Gibbs measures. We test the effectiveness of our schemes in systems with competing short- and long-range interactions, using an analytically solvable model as a computational benchmark. Furthermore, the cluster expansion in Katsoulakis et al. [M.A. Katsoulakis, L. Rey-Bellet, P. Plecha{\textasciiacute}c{\textasciicaron}, D. Tsagkarogiannis, Coarse-graining schemes and a posteriori error estimates for stochastic lattice systems, M2AN Math. Model. Numer.

  abstract = {The present work reports incompressible, viscous flow around a rigidly suspended stationary cube placed normal to the flow. The Reynolds number range covered in this work is more than two decades from Re {$\in$} (500, 55,000). Measurements are conducted using particle image velocimetry and dye visualization is undertaken for better understanding of the flow. The flow is seen to be structureless at higher Reynolds number. Mean and rms velocities at different axial locations in the wake are examined along with the mean vorticity field. Two peaks are observed in the Urms profiles at different axial locations in the wake. Vrms is single peaked at lower Re and has weak double peaks at higher Re. Behaviour of centerline velocity of the wake gives an insight about the recirculation length and shows its non-dependence on Re. Wake size has been determined and trajectory of the maximum vorticity in the wake is discussed. Drag coefficients are evaluated and compared with various correlations for sphere and cube. The modified wake survey method gives coefficients of drag between 0.63 and 0.89, which are close to the values for a cube given by H{\"o}lzer and Sommerfeld (2008) within the experimented Reynolds number range. Using the recirculation length, the data shows a dependence on Reynolds number till Re {$\sim$} 1200 beyond which it becomes independent of Re. Overall several similarities in the flow behaviour with respect to sphere is noted from the results. The paper is the first detailed study on a cube over such a wide range of Reynolds number.},

A fully implicit time advancement is employed to avoid the Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy restriction, where the Crank--Nicolson discretization is used for both the di usion and convection terms. Based on a block LU decomposition, velocity--pressure decoupling is achieved in conjunction with the approximate factorization. The main emphasis is placed on the additional decoupling of the intermediate velocity components with only nth time step velocity. The temporal second-order accuracy is preserved with the approximate factorization without any modi{\"y}cation of boundary conditions. Since the decoupled momentum equations are solved without iteration, the computational time is reduced signi{\"y}cantly. The present decoupling method is validated by solving several test cases, in particular, the turbulent minimal channel ow unit. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This lack in modeling is addressed in the present study with the aid of the one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model. ODT is applied as stand-alone column model to numerically investigate stratification effects in long-lived transient Ekman flows as canonical example of polar boundary layers by resolving turbulent winds and fluctuating temperature profiles on all relevant scales of the flow. We first calibrate the adjustable model parameters for neutral cases based on the surface drag law which yields slightly different optimal model set-ups for finite low and moderate Reynolds numbers. For the stably stratified cases, previously calibrated parameters are kept fixed and the model predictions are compared with various reference numerical simulations and also observations by an exploitation of boundary layer similarity. ODT reasonably captures the temporally developing flow for various prescribed stratification profiles, but fails to fully capture the near-surface laminarization by remaining longer in a fully developed turbulent state, which suggests preferential applicability to high-Reynolds-number flow regimes. Nevertheless, the model suggests that large near-surface turbulence scales are primarily affected by the developing stratification due to scale-selective buoyancy damping which agrees with the literature. The variability of the wind-turning angle represented by the ensemble of stratified cases simulated covers a wider range than reference reanalysis data. The present study suggests that the vertical-column ODT formulation that is highly resolved in space and time can help to accurately represent multi-physics boundary-layer and subgrid-scale processes, offering new opportunities for analysis of very stable polar boundary layer and atmospheric chemistry applications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The dynamical processes at work are entangled down to the molecular-diffusive scales that are determined by the Schmidt (Sc) and Reynolds (Re) number. Turbulence properties are generally nonuniversal which leads to high numerical resolution requirements. We address the numerical challenges associated with accuracy and feasibility by utilizing a stochastic one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model. Here, ODT is applied to turbulent Couette flow of dilute electrolytes as canonical problem for turbulent electroconvection. For Sc ⩾ O(10), ODT predicts an increase of the skin friction drag due to electrohydrodynamically (EHD) enhanced small-scale eddy production once the flow is sufficiently turbulent.},

EBLs achieve the bulk-surface coupling in Earth's atmosphere. They are numerically challenging due to transient and non-universal turbulence properties even at small scales. ODT addresses this problem by distinguishing turbulent-advective from molecular-diffusive transport processes for a vertical column along which all relevant scales of the flow are resolved. We demonstrate the model's capabilities for economical, accurate, and stratification regime independent simulation of EBLs for the wind-turning angle.

  abstract = {Distributed hydrological models simulate states and fluxes of water and energy in the terrestrial hydrosphere at each cell. The predicted spatial patterns result from complex nonlinear relationships and feedbacks. Spatial patterns are often neglected during the modeling process, and therefore a spatial sensitivity analysis framework that highlights their importance is proposed. This study features a comprehensive analysis of spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration (ET) and land surface temperature (LST), with the aim of quantifying the extent to which forcing data and model parameters drive these patterns. This framework is applied on a distributed model [MIKE Syst{\`e}me Hydrologique Europ{\'e}en (MIKE SHE)] coupled to a land surface model [Shuttleworth and Wallace--Evapotranspiration (SW-ET)] of a catchment in Denmark. Twenty-two scenarios are defined, each having a simplified representation of a potential driver of spatial variability. A baseline model that incorporates full spatial detail is used to assess sensitivity. High sensitivity can be attested in scenarios where the simulated spatial patterns differ significantly from the baseline. The core novelty of this study is that the analysis is based on a set of innovative spatial performance metrics that enable a reliable spatial pattern comparison. Overall, LST is very sensitive to air temperature and wind speed whereas ET is rather driven by vegetation. Both are sensitive to groundwater coupling and precipitation. The conclusions may be limited to the selected catchment and to the applied modeling system, but the suggested framework is generically relevant for the modeling community. While the applied metrics focus on specific spatial information, they partly exhibit redundant information. Thus, a combination of metrics is the ideal approach to evaluate spatial patterns in models outputs.},

For instance, the dynamical characteristics of large-scale motions in wall turbulence play an important role in predicting the dynamical loads on buildings, or the fluctuations in the power distribution across wind farms. Davenport (Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 1961, Vol. 372, 194-211) performed a seminal study on the subject and proposed a hypothesis that is still widely used to date. Here, we demonstrate how the empirical formulation of Davenport is consistent with the analysis of Baars et al. (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 2017, Vol. 823, R2) in the spirit of Townsend's attached-eddy hypothesis in wall turbulence. We further study stratification effects based on two-point measurements of atmospheric boundary-layer flow over the Utah salt flats. No self-similar scaling is observed in stable conditions, putting the application of Davenport's framework, as well as the attached-eddy hypothesis, in question for this case. Data obtained under unstable conditions exhibit clear self-similar scaling and our analysis reveals a strong sensitivity of the statistical aspect ratio of coherent structures (defined as the ratio of streamwise and wall-normal extent) to the magnitude of the stability parameter.},

  abstract = {We developed a simple, single-layer urban canopy model, and compared it to both multilayer and slab models. Our single-layer model has the following features: (a) It is a column model of energy and momentum exchange between an urban surface and the atmosphere, (b) it includes the influence of street canyons, which are parameterized to represent the urban geometry, (c) it includes shadowing from buildings and reflection of radiation, and (d) it estimates both the surface temperatures of, and heat fluxes from, three surface types: roof, wall, and road. In the simulation of the single-layer model, the roof was hottest during the daytime, but coolest from midnight to early morning. This is consistent with output from the multi-layer model and field observations at a residential area on a clear, summer day. The diurnal variation of the energy budget from the singlelayer model agrees well with that from the multi-layer model. Our single-layer model's performance is nearly that of a multi-layer model for studying mesoscale heat islands. Nevertheless, it is simply parameterized, and thus easily included in larger-scale atmospheric models. The slab model has the largest nighttime cooling rate of the three models. To overcome this, it needs more adjustments than for the canopy models.},

We found that the heat island circulation developed less strongly than when using the atmospheric model with the standard slab urban model. Additionally, the coupling with urban canopy model (i) delays the phase of surface air temperature, (ii) reduces the diurnal range of the temperature, and (iii) produces a nocturnal heat island, which results from the difference in atmospheric stability between city and its surroundings. The features from the atmospheric model coupled with the canopy model agree well with those from observation, although the atmospheric model with the slab model does not. The simulated nocturnal heat island is caused by the larger heat storage of the canopy model which releases sensible heat after sunset.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a finite difference code for Direct and Large Eddy Simulation (DNS/LES) of incompressible flows is presented. This code is an intermediate tool between fully spectral Navier--Stokes solvers (limited to academic geometry through Fourier or Chebyshev representation) and more versatile codes based on standard numerical schemes (typically only second-order accurate). The interest of high-order schemes is discussed in terms of implementation easiness, computational efficiency and accuracy improvement considered through simplified benchmark problems and practical calculations. The equivalence rules between operations in physical and spectral spaces are efficiently used to solve the Poisson equation introduced by the projection method. It is shown that for the pressure treatment, an accurate Fourier representation can be used for more flexible boundary conditions than periodicity or free-slip. Using the concept of the modified wave number, the incompressibility can be enforced up to the machine accuracy. The benefit offered by this alternative method is found to be very satisfactory, even when a formal second-order error is introduced locally by boundary conditions that are neither periodic nor symmetric. The usefulness of high-order schemes combined with an immersed boundary method (IBM) is also demonstrated despite the second-order accuracy introduced by this wall modelling strategy. In particular, the interest of a partially staggered mesh is exhibited in this specific context. Three-dimensional calculations of transitional and turbulent channel flows emphasize the ability of present high-order schemes to reduce the computational cost for a given accuracy. The main conclusion of this paper is that finite difference schemes with quasi-spectral accuracy can be very efficient for DNS/LES of incompressible flows, while allowing flexibility for the boundary conditions and easiness in the code development. Therefore, this compromise fits particularly well for very high-resolution simulations of turbulent flows with relatively complex geometries without requiring heavy numerical developments.},

In a coupled SBL, large turbulent eddies enhance cross-layer mixing and vertically well-mixed turbulent kinetic energy. However, large gradients in momentum and heat fluxes are frequently observed, degrading the performance of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. It is shown that increased vertical gradients of mean variables (i.e., wind speed and potential temperature) can cause flux gradients. This process is operated upon by downward penetrating large eddies with altered phase difference, contributing unevenly to fluxes and thus causing flux gradients. In the coupled SBL with small gradients in mean variables, large eddies are vertically synchronized, contributing evenly to fluxes across layers and thus causing small flux gradients. As turbulent production becomes weak and the cross-layer difference in turbulent flux transport increases, large eddies become less vertically synchronized, contributing unevenly to fluxes across layers and thus causing large flux gradients.},

The roughness takes the form of periodic two-dimensional bumps whose non-dimensional amplitude is fixed at a small value (                                                                      \$h{\textasciicircum}+=15\$                                               ) and whose mean slope is gentle. The neutral Ekman layer is subjected to a stabilizing cooling flux for approximately one inertial period (                                                                      \$2\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}pi\} /f\$                                               ) to impose the stratification. The Ekman boundary layer is in a transitionally rough regime and, without stratification, the effect of roughness is found to be mild in contrast to the stratified case. Roughness, whose effect increases with the slope of the bumps, changes the boundary layer qualitatively from the very stable (Mahrt,               Theor. Comput. Fluid Dyn.               , vol. 11, issue 3--4, 1998, pp. 263--279) regime, which has a strong thermal inversion and a pronounced low-level jet, in the flat case to the stable regime, which has a weaker thermal inversion and stronger surface-layer turbulence, in the rough cases. The flat case exhibits initial collapse of turbulence which eventually recovers, albeit with inertial oscillations in turbulent kinetic energy. The roughness elements interrupt the initial collapse of turbulence. In the quasi-steady state, the thickness of the turbulent stress profiles and of the near-surface region with subcritical gradient Richardson number increase in the rough cases. Analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget shows that, in the surface layer, roughness counteracts the stability-induced reduction of TKE production. The flow component, coherent with the surface undulations, is extracted by a triple decomposition, and leads to a dispersive component of near-surface turbulent fluxes. The significance of the dispersive component increases in the stratified cases.},

  abstract = {Finite-amplitude manifestations of stratified shear flow instabilities and their spatio-temporal coherent structures are believed to play an important role in turbulent geophysical flows. Such shear flows commonly have layers separated by sharp density interfaces, and are therefore susceptible to the so-called Holmboe instability, and its finite-amplitude manifestation, the Holmboe wave. In this paper, we describe and elucidate the origin of an apparently previously unreported long-lived coherent structure in a sustained stratified shear flow generated in the laboratory by exchange flow through an inclined square duct connecting two reservoirs filled with fluids of different densities. Using a novel measurement technique allowing for time-resolved, near-instantaneous measurements of the three-component velocity and density fields simultaneously over a three-dimensional volume, we describe the three-dimensional geometry and spatio-temporal dynamics of this structure. We identify it as a finite-amplitude, nonlinear, asymmetric confined Holmboe wave (CHW), and highlight the importance of its spanwise (lateral) confinement by the duct boundaries. We pay particular attention to the spanwise vorticity, which exhibits a travelling, near-periodic structure of sheared, distorted, prolate spheroids with a wide `body' and a narrower `head'. Using temporal linear stability analysis on the two-dimensional streamwise-averaged experimental flow, we solve for three-dimensional perturbations having two-dimensional, cross-sectionally confined eigenfunctions and a streamwise normal mode. We show that the dispersion relation and the three-dimensional spatial structure of the fastest-growing confined Holmboe instability are in good agreement with those of the observed confined Holmboe wave. We also compare those results with a classical linear analysis of two-dimensional perturbations (i.e. with no spanwise dependence) on a one-dimensional base flow. We conclude that the lateral confinement is an important ingredient of the confined Holmboe instability, which gives rise to the CHW, with implications for many inherently confined geophysical flows such as in valleys, estuaries, straits or deep ocean trenches. Our results suggest that the CHW is an example of an experimentally observed, inherently nonlinear, robust, long-lived coherent structure which has developed from a linear instability. We conjecture that the CHW is a promising candidate for a class of exact coherent states underpinning the dynamics of more disordered, yet continually forced stratified shear flows.},

  abstract = {Abstract Over the last 100 years, boundary layer meteorology grew from the subject of mostly near-surface observations to a field encompassing diverse atmospheric boundary layers (ABLs) around the world. From the start, researchers drew from an ever-expanding set of disciplines---thermodynamics, soil and plant studies, fluid dynamics and turbulence, cloud microphysics, and aerosol studies. Research expanded upward to include the entire ABL in response to the need to know how particles and trace gases dispersed, and later how to represent the ABL in numerical models of weather and climate (starting in the 1970s--80s); taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by the development of large-eddy simulations (1970s), direct numerical simulations (1990s), and a host of instruments to sample the boundary layer in situ and remotely from the surface, the air, and space. Near-surface flux-profile relationships were developed rapidly between the 1940s and 1970s, when rapid progress shifted to the fair-weather convective boundary layer (CBL), though tropical CBL studies date back to the 1940s. In the 1980s, ABL research began to include the interaction of the ABL with the surface and clouds, the first ABL parameterization schemes emerged; and land surface and ocean surface model development blossomed. Research in subsequent decades has focused on more complex ABLs, often identified by shortcomings or uncertainties in weather and climate models, including the stable boundary layer, the Arctic boundary layer, cloudy boundary layers, and ABLs over heterogeneous surfaces (including cities). The paper closes with a brief summary, some lessons learned, and a look to the future.},

Several values of the pitch ({$\lambda\lambda$}\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}lambda\}) to height (kkk) ratio and two Reynolds numbers are considered. The roughness increases the heat transfer by inducing ejections at the leading edge of the roughness elements. The amounts of heat transfer and mixing depend on the separation between the roughness elements, an increase in heat transfer accompanying an increase in drag. The ratio of non-dimensional heat flux to the non-dimensional wall shear stress is higher for circular rods than square bars irrespectively of the pitch to height ratio. The turbulent heat flux varies within the cavities and is larger near the roughness elements. Both momentum and thermal eddy diffusivities increase relative to the smooth wall. For square cavities ({$\lambda$}/k=2{$\lambda$}/k=2\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}lambda\}/k=2) the turbulent Prandtl number is smaller than for a smooth channel near the wall. As {$\lambda$}/k{$\lambda$}/k\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}lambda\}/k increases, the turbulent Prandtl number increases up to a maximum of 2.5 at the crests plane of the square bars ({$\lambda$}/k=7.5{$\lambda$}/k=7.5\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}lambda\}/k=7.5). With increasing distance from the wall, the differences with respect to the smooth wall vanish and at three roughness heights above the crests plane, the turbulent Prandtl number is essentially the same for smooth and rough walls.},

  abstract = {The turbulent energy spectra and cospectra of momentum and sensible heat fluxes are examined theoretically and experimentally with increasing flux Richardson number (Rf) in the stable atmospheric surface layer. A cospectral budget model, previously used to explain the bulk relation between the turbulent Prandtl number (Prt) and the gradient Richardson number (Ri) as well as the relation between Rf and Ri, is employed to interpret field measurements over a lake and a glacier. The shapes of the vertical velocity and temperature spectra, needed for closing the cospectral budget model, are first examined with increasing Rf. In addition, the wavenumber-dependent relaxation time scales for momentum and heat fluxes are inferred from the cospectral budgets and investigated. Using experimental data and proposed extensions to the cospectral budget model, the existence of a `-1' power-law scaling in the temperature spectra but its absence from the vertical velocity spectra is shown to reduce the magnitude of the maximum flux Richardson number (Rfm), which is commonly inferred from the Rf --Ri relation when Ri becomes very large (idealized with Ri {$\rightarrow$} {$\infty$}). Moreover, dissimilarity in relaxation time scales between momentum and heat fluxes, also affected by the existence of the `-1' power-law scaling in the temperature spectra, leads to Prt = 1 under near-neutral conditions. It is further shown that the production rate of turbulent kinetic energy decreases more rapidly than that of turbulent potential energy as Rf {$\rightarrow$} Rfm, which explains the observed disappearance of the inertial subrange in the vertical velocity spectra at a smaller Rf as compared to its counterpart in the temperature spectra. These results further demonstrate novel linkages between the scale-wise turbulent kinetic energy and potential energy distributions and macroscopic relations such as stability correction functions to the mean flow and the Prt--Ri relation.},

  abstract = {The air--water exchange of momentum and scalars (temperature and water vapour) is investigated using the Lake-Atmosphere Turbulent EXchange (LATEX) dataset. The wind waves and swell are found to affect the coupling between the water surface and the air differently. The surface-stress vector aligns with the wind velocity in the presence of wind waves, but a wide range of stress--wind misalignment angles is observed during swell. The momentum transport efficiency decreases when significant stress--wind misalignment is present, suggesting a strong influence of surface wave properties on surface drag. Based on this improved understanding of the role of wave--wind misalignment, a new relative wind speed for surface-layer similarity formulations is proposed and tested using the data. The new expression yields a value of the von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n constant ({$\kappa$}) of 0.38, compared to 0.36 when using the absolute wind speed, as well as reduced data fitting errors. Finally, the ratios of aerodynamic to scalar roughness lengths are computed and various existing models in the literature are tested using least-square fitting to the observed ratios. The tests are able to discriminate between the performance of various models; however, they also indicate that more investigations are required to understand the physics of scalar exchanges over waves.},

Their dependence on flow properties such as the Reynolds number remains controversial. In particular, two important power laws (``1/4'' and ``1/2''), both having strong theoretical foundations, have been widely used in various parameterizations and models. Building on a previously proposed phenomenological model for interactions between the viscous sublayer and the turbulent flow, it is shown here that the two scaling laws can be reconciled. The 1/4 power law corresponds to the situation where the vertical diffusion is balanced by the temporal change or advection due to a constant velocity in the viscous sublayer, while the 1/2 scaling corresponds to the situation where the vertical diffusion is balanced by the advection due to a linear velocity profile in the viscous sublayer. In addition, the recently proposed ``1'' power law scaling is also recovered, which corresponds to the situation where molecular diffusion dominates the scalar budget in the viscous sublayer. The formulation proposed here provides a unified framework for understanding the onset of these different scaling laws and offers a new perspective on how to evaluate them experimentally.},

Due to high dimensionality and parameter interaction, estimating parameters of an LSM is a challenging task. Sensitivity analysis (SA) is a tool that can screen out the most influential parameters on model outputs. In this study, we conducted parameter screening for six output fluxes for the Common Land Model: sensible heat, latent heat, upward longwave radiation, net radiation, soil temperature and soil moisture. A total of 40 adjustable parameters were considered. Five qualitative SA methods, including local, sum-of-trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines, delta test and Morris methods, were compared. The proper sampling design and sufficient sample size necessary to effectively screen out the sensitive parameters were examined. We found that there are 2--8 sensitive parameters, depending on the output type, and about 400 samples are adequate to reliably identify the most sensitive parameters. We also employed a revised Sobol' sensitivity method to quantify the importance of all parameters. The total effects of the parameters were used to assess the contribution of each parameter to the total variances of the model outputs. The results confirmed that global SA methods can generally identify the most sensitive parameters effectively, while local SA methods result in type I errors (i.e., sensitive parameters labeled as insensitive) or type II errors (i.e., insensitive parameters labeled as sensitive). Finally, we evaluated and confirmed the screening results for their consistency with the physical interpretation of the model parameters.},

Detailed comparisons were made with both wind-tunnel experiments and field observations. The LES was shown to correctly capture the spatial patterns of the transfer coefficients around two-dimensional roughness ribs (with a discrepancy of about 20\%) and the average Nusselt number (Nu) over a single wall mounted cube (with a discrepancy of about 25\%) relative to wind tunnel measurements. However, the discrepancy in Re between the wind tunnel measurements and the real-world applications that the code aims to address influence the comparisons since Nu is a function of Re. Evaluations against field observations are therefore done to overcome this challenge; they reveal that, for applications in urban areas, the wind-tunnel studies result in a much lower range for the exponent m in the classic Nu{$\sim$}Rem relations, compared to field measurements and LES (0.52--0.74 versus{$\approx$}0.9). The results underline the importance of conducting experimental or numerical studies for convective scalar transfer problems at a Re commensurate with the flow of interest, and support the use of wall-modeled LES as a technique for this problem that can already capture important aspects of the physics, although further development and testing are needed.},

  abstract = {According to Townsend's hypothesis, so-called wall-attached eddies are the main contributors to turbulent transport in the atmospheric surface layer (ASL). This is also one of the main assumptions of Monin--Obukhov similarity theory (MOST). However, previous evidence seems to indicate that outerscale eddies can impact the ASL, resulting in deviations from the classic MOST scaling. We conduct largeeddy simulations and direct numerical simulations of a dry convective boundary layer to investigate the impact of coherent structures on the ASL. A height-dependent passive tracer enables coherent structure detection and conditional analysis based on updrafts and subsidence. The MOST similarity functions computed from the simulation results indicate a larger deviation of the momentum similarity function fm from classical scaling relationships compared to the temperature similarity function fh. The conditionalaveraged fm for updrafts and subsidence are similar, indicating strong interactions between the inner and outer layers. However, fh conditioned on subsidence follows the mixed-layer scaling, while its updraft counterpart is well predicted by MOST. Updrafts are the dominant contributors to the transport of momentum and temperature. Subsidence, which comprises eddies that originate from the outer layer, contributes increasingly to the transport of temperature with increasing instability. However, u0 of different signs are distributed symmetrically in subsidence unlike the predominantly negative u0 as instability increases. Thus, the spatial patterns of u0w0 differ compared to u0w0 in regions of subsidence. These results depict the mechanisms for departure from the MOST scaling, which is related to the stronger role of subsidence.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulations are conducted to contrast momentum and passive scalar transport over large, three-dimensional roughness elements in a turbulent channel flow. Special attention is given to the dispersive fluxes, which are shown to be a significant fraction of the total flux within the roughness sublayer. Based on pointwise quadrant analysis, the turbulent components of the transport of momentum and scalars are found to be similar in general, albeit with increasing dissimilarity for roughnesses with low frontal blockage. However, strong dissimilarity is noted between the dispersive momentum and scalar fluxes, especially below the top of the roughness elements. In general, turbulence is found to transport momentum more efficiently than scalars, while the reverse applies to the dispersive contributions. The effects of varying surface geometries, measured by the frontal density, are pronounced on turbulent fluxes and even more so on dispersive fluxes. Increasing frontal density induces a general transition in the flow from a wall bounded type to a mixing layer type. This transition results in an increase in the efficiency of turbulent momentum transport, but the reverse occurs for scalars due to reduced contributions from large-scale motions in the roughness sublayer. This study highlights the need for distinct parameterizations of the turbulent and dispersive fluxes, as well as the importance of considering the contrasts between momentum and scalar transport for flows over very rough surfaces.},

As LES resolves the obstacles but not the micro-scale boundary layers attached to them, the aforementioned roughness lengths are analyzed at two distinct spatial scales. At the micro-scale (roughness of individual facets, e.g., roofs), it is assumed that both momentum and scalar transfer are governed by accepted arguments for smooth walls that form the basis for the LES wall-model. At the macro-scale, the roughness lengths are representative of the aggregate effects of momentum and scalar transfer over the resolved roughness elements of the whole surface, and hence they are directly computed from the LES. The results indicate that morphologically based parametrizations for macro-scale z0m are adequate overall. The relation between the momentum and scalar macro-roughness values, as conventionally represented by and assumed to scale with (where Re{$\ast$} is a roughness Reynolds number), is then interpreted using surface renewal theory (SRT). SRT predicts n = 1/4 when only Kolmogorov-scale eddies dominate the scalar exchange, whereas n = 1/2 is predicted when large eddies limit the renewal dynamics. The latter is found to better capture the LES results. However, both scaling relations indicate that z0s decreases when z0m increases for typical urban geometries and scales. This is opposite to how their relation is usually modelled for urban canopies (i.e., z0s/z0m is a fixed value smaller than unity).},

Each cubical complex is defined as a set of grid cells that have the same sign of vertical velocity, either positive or negative. Low-order topological invariants, namely the Betti numbers of the cubical complexes, are found to capture key aspects of the boundary-layer organization and evolution over the diurnal cycle. An unsupervised-learning algorithm is trained using the topological invariants in order to classify the spatio--temporal evolution of convection over a whole day.

  abstract = {The statistical features of turbulence can be studied either through spectral quantities,  such as the kinetic energy spectrum, or through structure functions, which are statistical  moments of the difference between velocities at two points separated by a variable  distance. In this paper structure function relations for two-dimensional turbulence  are derived and compared with calculations based on wind data from 5754 airplane  flights, reported in the MOZAIC data set. For the third-order structure function  two relations are derived, showing that this function is generally positive in the two-dimensional case, contrary to the three-dimensional case. In the energy inertial range  the third-order structure function grows linearly with separation distance and in the  enstrophy inertial range it grows cubically with separation distance. A Fourier analysis  shows that the linear growth is a reflection of a constant negative spectral energy flux,  and the cubic growth is a reflection of a constant positive spectral enstrophy flux.  Various relations between second-order structure functions and spectral quantities  are also derived. The measured second-order structure functions can be divided into  two different types of terms, one of the form               r               2/3               , giving a               k               -5/3               -range and another, including a logarithmic dependence,  giving a               k               -3               -range in the energy spectrum. The  structure functions agree better with the two-dimensional isotropic relation for larger  separations than for smaller separations. The flatness factor is found to grow very fast  for separations of the order of some kilometres. The third-order structure function  is accurately measured in the interval [30, 300] km and is found to be positive. The  average enstrophy flux is measured as               {$\Pi$}               {$\omega$}               {$\approx$}1.8{\texttimes}10               -13               s               -3               and the constant in the               k               -3               -law is measured as [Kscr    ]{$\approx$}0.19. It is  argued that the               k               -3               -range can be explained by two-dimensional  turbulence and can be interpreted as an enstrophy inertial range, while the               k               -5/3               -range can probably not be explained by two-dimensional  turbulence and should not be interpreted as a two-dimensional energy inertial range.},

  abstract = {A climatology of the boundary-layer wind-turning angle over land is presented based on radiosonde observations from 800 stations in the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA). The dependence of the wind turning on a suite of parameters is analyzed. Results from previous studies indicating the importance of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) stratification for the angle of wind turning are confirmed here. A clear increase in the wind-turning angle with wind speed, particularly for stratified conditions, is also evident. According to Rossby number similarity theory, the cross-isobaric angle for a neutral and barotropic boundary layer decreases with increasing surface Rossby number, Ro. The IGRA observations indicate that this dependence on Ro might partly be linked to the dependence of the stratification on the wind speed, a dependence that seems to prevail even for the high wind speeds, a criterion that traditionally is used to approximate a neutral PBL. The vertical distribution of the turning of the wind is analyzed using the high-resolution Stratospheric Processes And their Role in Climate (SPARC) data. For unstable cases, there is a maximum in the directional wind shear around the PBL top, whereas for the most stable class of cases there is a maximum near the surface. The wind-turning angles from observations are also compared with values obtained from ERA-Interim reanalysis fields, also presented over ocean. ERA-Interim underestimates the magnitude of the wind-turning angles as well as the range. Furthermore, the midlatitude cross-isobaric mass transport is estimated using the IGRA data. This transport is generally underestimated by ERA-Interim, likely related to the too small wind-turning angles.},

We investigate the propagation of land-surface heterogeneity in a convective boundary layer using an atmosphere and land-surface coupled large-eddy model. Simulations are made for land surfaces of different heterogeneity scales and a uniform land surface. A multi-scale analysis is carried out and it is found that while domain-and-time averaged fluxes and state variables are not sensitive to land-surface heterogeneity, atmospheric patterns are. Close to the surface, atmospheric patterns are dominated by land-surface forced patterns; away from the surface, ``eigen'' patterns dominate and forced patterns reemerge for large averaging times. While small-scale land-surface features are more rapidly destroyed by turbulence, large-scale features can persist over hundreds of meters.},

  abstract = {The land-atmosphere system is characterized by pronounced land surface heterogeneity and vigorous atmospheric turbulence both covering a wide range of scales. The multiscale surface heterogeneities and multiscale turbulent eddies interact nonlinearly with each other. Understanding these multiscale processes quantitatively is essential to the subgrid parameterizations for weather and climate models. In this paper, we propose a method for surface heterogeneity quantification and turbulence structure identification. The first part of the method is an orthogonal transform in the probability density function (PDF) domain, in contrast to the orthogonal wavelet transforms which are performed in the physical space. As the basis of the whole method, the orthogonal PDF transform (OPT) is used to asymptotically reconstruct the original signals by representing the signal values with multilevel approximations. The ``patch'' idea is then applied to these reconstructed fields in order to recognize areas at the land surface or in turbulent flows that are of the same characteristics. A patch here is a connected area with the same approximation. For each recognized patch, a length scale is then defined to build the energy spectrum. The OPT and related energy spectrum analysis, as a whole referred to as the orthogonal PDF decomposition (OPD), is applied to two-dimensional heterogeneous land surfaces and atmospheric turbulence fields for test. The results show that compared to the wavelet transforms, the OPD can reconstruct the original signal more effectively, and accordingly, its energy spectrum represents the signal's multiscale variation more accurately. The method we propose in this paper is of general nature and therefore can be of interest for problems of multiscale process description in other geophysical disciplines.},

Numerical experiments, using the large eddy simulation FLUENT code, have been conducted under neutral stability conditions to test 5 building geometries: i) flat roof, ii) pitched roof, iii) round roof, iv) terraced building and v) building with balconies. Wind tunnel experiments were also conducted for the first three geometries. The simulation and experimental setups were closely matched and both featured configurations consisting of seven building arrays. The results from the physical and numerical experiments concur that (i) in-canyon vortex dynamics and over-canopy flow conditions, are strongly dependent on the geometric features of the buildings, and (ii) pitched and round roof geometries increase in-canyon mean and turbulent velocities, as well as the depth of the shear layer. The findings provide novel insight on the sensitivity of the flow and turbulence fields, as well as the simulation quality, to urban topography, inflow conditions, and the Reynolds number. They also underline the influence on the flow of small-scale features such as balconies, which are often ignored in prior literature.},

The objective was to extend previous works that studied the flow over sudden changes in aerodynamic roughness length occurring typically in the transition between small vegetation and forest but neglected the variations of displacement height. It was found that the internal boundary layers that formed in the transition between surface patches initially grew similarly for both the sudden changes of roughness and the alternating forest patches and clearings, but the turbulence produced at the tops of trees could break the regular growth, increasing the vertical propagation of surface heterogeneity and, consequently, the blending height. Also, the forest patches enhanced the Reynolds shear stress at the tree height over the clearings: when the energy extraction by the forest canopy ceased, the turbulent fluctuations increased and the turbulent shear production was kept high over much of the following clearing. Consequently, the Reynolds shear stress over the clearings decayed slowly, or not at all in the case of short patches. This resulted in higher average shear stress and effective aerodynamic roughness length than was the case when variations of displacement height were neglected.},

It vanishes if the density stratification is horizontal and statically stable everywhere, and is positive otherwise. It is measured approximately by a weighted vertical average of the horizontal variance of temperature. In magnitude it is generally about ten times the total kinetic energy, but less than one per cent of the total potential energy. Under adiabatic flow the sum of the available potential energy and the kinetic energy is conserved, but large increases in available potential energy are usually accompanied by increases in kinetic energy, and therefore involve nonadiabatic effects. Available potential energy may be partitioned into zonal and eddy energy by an analysis of variance of the temperature field. The zonal form may be converted into the eddy form by an eddy-transport of sensible heat toward colder latitudes, while each form may be converted into the corresponding form of kinetic energy. The general circulation is characterized by a conversion of zonal available potential energy, which is generated by low-latitude heating and high-latitude cooling, to eddy available potential energy, to eddy kinetic energy, to zonal kinetic energy.},

Through the use of double Fourier series, and with the omission of all but the largest scales of motion, the barotropic vorticity equation may be reduced to a system of three ordinary nonlinear differential equations. The analytic solutions of these equations are elliptic functions of time. The equations may also be solved rapidly by numerical integration. Particular solutions of the equations picture the motion of finite disturbances on a zonal flow, with exchanges of kinetic energy between the zonal flow and the disturbances accompanying the meridional transport of zonal momentum by the disturbances. Other solutions picture the initial growth and eventual cessation of growth of small disturbances on an unstable zonal current. Still further solutions picture the destruction of a stable zonal flow by large disturbances, and lead to a plausible hypothesis concerning index cycles in the atmosphere. Less extreme simplifications of the dynamic equations may be used when more complicated atmospheric phenomena are to be studied.},

  abstract = {Two parameterisation schemes for the turbulent surface fluxes and drag coefficients over the Arctic marginal sea-ice zone (MIZ) are (further) developed, and their results are compared with each other. Although the schemes are based on different principles (flux averaging and parameter averaging), the resulting drag coefficients differ only slightly in the case of neutral and stable stratification. For unstable stratification and sea-ice conditions being typical for the north-eastern Fram Strait, the drag coefficients resulting from the parameter-averaging concept are 5--10\% larger than those of the flux-averaging concept. At a sea-ice concentration of 45\%, the parameter-averaging method overestimates the heat fluxes by a factor of 1.2. An inclusion of form-drag in the schemes caused by floe edges and ridges has a much larger effect on the drag coefficient, and on the momentum fluxes, than the choice between the parameter-averaging or flux-averaging methods. Based on sensitivity studies with the flux-averaging scheme, a simple formula for the effective drag coefficient above the Arctic MIZ is derived. It reduces the computational costs of the more complex parameterisations and could also be used in larger scale models. With this simple formula, the effective drag coefficient can be calculated as a function of the sea-ice concentration and skin drag coefficients for water and ice floes. The results obtained with this parameterisation differ only slightly from those using the more complex schemes. Finally, it is shown that in the MIZ, drag coefficients for sea-ice models may differ significantly from the effective drag coefficients used in atmospheric models.},

  abstract = {Recently, with the advent of supercomputers, there has been considerable interest in the use of direct numerical simulation to obtain information about turbulent shear flow at low Reynolds number. This paper presents a pseudospectral technique to solve the full three-dimensional time-dependent Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion equations without the use of subgrid-scale modelling. The technique has not been previously used for fully developed turbulent channel flow simulation and is based on methods applied inother contexts. The emphasis of this paper is to provide a reasonably detailed account of how the simulation is done rather than to present new calculations of turbulence. The details of an algorithm for turbulent channel flow simulation and the grid and time step sizes needed to integrate through transient behaviour to steady state turbulence have not been published before and are presented here.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric boundary layers with weak stratification are relatively well described by similarity theory and numerical models for stationary horizontally homogeneous conditions. With common strong stratification, similarity theory becomes unreliable. The turbulence structure and interactions with the mean flow and small-scale nonturbulent motions assume a variety of scenarios. The turbulence is intermittent and may no longer fully satisfy the usual conditions for the definition of turbulence. Nonturbulent motions include wave-like motions and solitary modes, two-dimensional vortical modes, microfronts, intermittent drainage flows, and a host of more complex structures. The main source of turbulence may not be at the surface, but rather may result from shear above the surface inversion. The turbulence is typically not in equilibrium with the nonturbulent motions, sometimes preventing the formation of an inertial subrange. New observational and analysis techniques are expected to advance our understanding of the very stable boundary layer.},

Examination of the dependence of the nocturnal boundary layer on stability suggests three regimes: a) the weakly stable case, b) a transition stability regime where many of the variables change rapidly with increasing stability and c) the very stable case. The value of z/L where the downward heat flux is a maximum defines the stability boundary between the weakly stable and transition regimes, where L is the Obukhov length. In the present analysis, the downward heat flux reaches a maximum at z/L approximately equal to 0.05 for 10 m, although comparison with other data indicates that this is not a universal value. For weaker stability, the heat flux decreases with decreasing z/L due to weaker temperature fluctuations. In the transition stability regime, the heat flux decreases rapidly with increasing stability due to restriction of vertical velocity fluctuations by the increasing stratification.},

Our survey emphasizes the development of non-equilibrium turbulence caused by non-stationary forcing. The degree of non-equilibrium of the turbulence is most reliably evaluated following the local flow rather than using the more available fixed-point measurements. We survey methods to eliminate non-stationary records or partially filter out the non-stationarity. We also summarize issues with parametrization of the non-stationarity. Non-stationarity over the sea can be complex due to time-dependent wave state and surface roughness. The impact of non-stationarity is generally less understood in the stable boundary layer compared to the unstable boundary layer.},

A formulation of the mixing length is examined, which approaches z-less similarity for large z and surface layer similarity close to the ground surface. A generalized version includes a dependence on boundary layer depth, which approaches the usual boundary layer height dependence for neutral conditions. However, for many of the observational cases, a boundary layer did not exist in the usual sense, in that turbulence was generated primarily above the surface inversion layer and occasionally extended downward toward the surface. For these cases, inclusion of z-less turbulence is crucial.},

Based on an extensive interpretive literature survey and new eddy correlation data for the stable boundary layer, this study defines two prototype stable boundary layers: the weakly stable case and the very stable case. The weakly stable boundary layer is amenable to existing models. The very stable boundary layer eludes modeling attempts due to breakdown of existing formulations of turbulence and due to features found in the atmosphere which are not normally included in models. The latter includes clear-air radiative cooling, low-level jets, surface heterogeneity, gravity waves, meandering motions, and other mesoscale motions which propagate from outside the local domain. While these mechanisms are not essential to understanding idealized or laboratory versions of the stable boundary layer, they complicate comparisons of numerical models and theories with actual atmospheric boundary layers. Statistics which describe various features of the stable boundary layer are offered for future comparison with modeling results.},

Examining state-of-the-art [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)] climate model projections, we find that QRA events are likely to increase by {\textasciitilde}50\% this century under business-as-usual carbon emissions, but there is considerable variation among climate models. Some predict a near tripling of QRA events by the end of the century, while others predict a potential decrease. Models with amplified Arctic warming yield the most pronounced increase in QRA events. The projections are strongly dependent on assumptions regarding the nature of changes in radiative forcing associated with anthropogenic aerosols over the next century. One implication of our findings is that a reduction in midlatitude aerosol loading could actually lead to Arctic de-amplification this century, ameliorating potential increases in persistent extreme weather events.},

  abstract = {We present a method using Doppler lidar data for identifying the main sources of turbulent mixing within the atmospheric boundary layer. The method identifies the presence of turbulence and then assigns a turbulent source by combining several lidar quantities: attenuated backscatter coefficient, vertical velocity skewness, dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, and vector wind shear. Both buoyancy--driven and shear--driven situations are identified, and the method operates in both clear--sky and cloud--topped conditions, with some reservations in precipitation. To capture the full seasonal cycle, the classification method was applied to more than one year of data from two sites, Hyyti{\"a}l{\"a}, Finland, and J{\"u}lich, Germany. Analysis showed seasonal variation in the diurnal cycle at both sites; a clear diurnal cycle was observed in spring, summer, and autumn seasons, but due to their respective latitudes, a weaker cycle in winter at J{\"u}lich, and almost non--existent at Hyyti{\"a}l{\"a}. Additionally, there are significant contributions from sources other than convective mixing, with cloud--driven mixing being observed even within the first 500 m above ground. Also evident is the considerable amount of nocturnal mixing within the lowest 500 m at both sites, especially during the winter. The presence of a low--level jet was often detected when sources of nocturnal mixing were diagnosed as wind--shear. The classification scheme, and the climatology extracted from the classification, provide insight into the processes responsible for mixing within the atmospheric boundary layer, how variable in space and time these can be, and how they vary with location.},

Each grid box is divided into fractions of different types of land use with independent solutions of the surface energy budget. An area-weighted average of the energy fluxes is computed to couple with the atmosphere, assuming the air above the surface is well blended at a given height. In the framework of validation of the tiling method, the ECMWF land surface scheme has been tested in offline mode driven by meteorological forcing provided by the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). Two contrasting surfaces in the boreal region of southern Finland are considered: a Scots pine forest (Hyyti{\texteuro}al{\texteuro}a) and a small nearby lake (Valkea-Kotinen). The field observations are used to evaluate the land surface model simulations for both energy fluxes and reservoirs. The model is able to characterize the main difference between the two sites, which appears in the energy partitioning, explained by the lake's large thermal inertia. In fact, while a large portion of the incoming solar radiation in the forest is released as sensible heat, the lake stores a substantial amount of energy in the water during late spring and summer and releases it in autumn. The different behavior of the fluxes both on annual and diurnal time scales confirms the benefit of a tiling mechanism in the presence of large contrast. However, it is also shown that the assumption of similar conditions at the blending height introduces errors.},

  abstract = {Purpose To describe methods reported in the literature to estimate the beginning or duration of pregnancy in automated health care data, and to present results of validation exercises where available. Methods Papers reporting methods for determining the beginning or duration of pregnancy were identified based on Pubmed searches, by consulting investigators with expertise in the field and by reviewing conference abstracts and reference lists of relevant papers. From each paper or abstract, we extracted information to characterize the study population, data sources, and estimation algorithm. We then grouped these studies into categories reflecting their general methodological approach. Results Methods were classified into 5 categories: (i) methods that assign a uniform duration for all pregnancies, (ii) methods that assign pregnancy duration based on preterm-delivery or health care related codes, or codes for other pregnancy outcomes, (iii) methods based on the timing of prenatal care, (iv) methods based on birth weight, and (v) methods that combine elements from 2 and 3. Validation studies evaluating these methods used varied approaches, with results generally reporting on the mistiming of the start of pregnancy, incorrect estimation of the duration of pregnancy, or misclassification of drug exposure during pregnancy or early pregnancy. Conclusions In the absence of accurate information on the beginning or duration of pregnancy, several methods of varying complexity are available to estimate them. Validation studies have been performed for many of them and can serve as a guide for method selection for a particular study. Copyright {\copyright} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The DNS results were used to evaluate several closure approximations that model the turbulent stresses in the Reynolds averaged momentum equations. Two first-order closure equations proposed by O'Brien and by Large, McWilliams, and Doney were tested; both models approximate the eddy diffusivity as a function of height using cubic polynomials. Of these two models, the O'Brien model, which requires data both at the surface layer and at the top of the boundary layer, proved superior. The higher-order k--<< model also agreed well with DNS results and more accurately represented the eddy diffusivity in this rotational flow.},

It shows how Leonardo's remaining works offer a complicated picture of unfinished, scattered, and frequently revisited hypotheses and conclusions. It argues that experimentation formed an important mechanism for Leonardo's thought about natural fluid flows, which was an innovation to the scientific thinking of his day, but which did not always lead him to the conclusions of modern fluid mechanics. It highlights the multiple and ambiguous meanings of turbulence in his works. It examines his thinking suggestive of modern concepts such as the no-slip condition, hydraulic jump, cardiovascular vortices, conservation of volume, and the distinctive path of ascending bubbles we now term Leonardo's paradox, among others. It demonstrates how Leonardo thought through analogies, building-block flow patterns, and synthesis, leading both to successes---especially in the management of water---and to failures, perhaps most obviously in his pursuit of human flight.},

The cases considered are free convection, a moderately stable boundary layer [first Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS)] case, shallow cumulus [Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX)], shallow precipitating cumulus [Rain in Cumulus over the Ocean (RICO)] and nocturnal stratocumulus [Second Dynamics and Chemistry of the Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS-II) field study RF01]. An identical LES setup, including advection discretization and SGS model parameters, is used for all cases, which is a stringent test on the ability of LES to accurately capture diverse conditions without any flow-adjustable parameters. The LES predictions agree well with observations and previously reported model results. A grid-resolution convergence study is carried out, and for all cases the mean profiles exhibit good grid-resolution independence, even for resolutions that are typically considered coarse. Second-order statistics, for example, variances, converge at finer resolutions compared to domain means. The simulations show that 90\% of the turbulent kinetic energy (at each level) must be resolved to obtain sufficiently converged mean profiles. This empirical convergence criterion can be used as a guide in designing future LES runs.},

The summertime wave may be compared with the wave generated by a small ridge, though with the phase reversed. The mechanism for exciting the wave is found to be the internal boundary layer developing due to horizontal variations in surface temperature and roughness length. During the more exploratory wintertime simulations, with substantial temperature difference between the lead and the ice surface, we find that secondary circulations and intermittent wave-breaking may occur. The effects of the lead appear far downstream.},

The method overcomes the statistical problems associated with the widely used Monin--Obukhov stability parameter. The results of the Ri-based scaling confirm the presence of three regimes: the weakly and the very stable regimes and the transition in between them. In the weakly stable regime, fluxes scale in proportion with variance, while in the very stable regime, stress and scalar fluxes behave differently. At large Ri, the velocity field becomes highly anisotropic and the turbulent potential energy becomes approximately equal to half of the turbulent kinetic energy. It appears that even in the strongly stable regime, beyond what is known as the critical gradient Richardson number, turbulent motions are present.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a turbulence closure for neutral and stratified atmospheric conditions. The closure is based on the concept of the total turbulent energy. The total turbulent energy is the sum of the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent potential energy, which is proportional to the potential temperature variance. The closure uses recent observational findings to take into account the mean flow stability. These observations indicate that turbulent transfer of heat and momentum behaves differently under very stable stratification. Whereas the turbulent heat flux tends toward zero beyond a certain stability limit, the turbulent stress stays finite. The suggested scheme avoids the problem of self-correlation. The latter is an improvement over the widely used Monin--Obukhov-based closures. Numerous large-eddy simulations, including a wide range of neutral and stably stratified cases, are used to estimate likely values of two free constants. In a benchmark case the new turbulence closure performs indistinguishably from independent large-eddy simulations.},

  abstract = {The immersed boundary method is a numerical and mathematical formulation for solving fluid-structure interaction problems. It relies on solving fluid equations on an Eulerian fluid grid and interpolating the resulting velocity back onto immersed structures. To resolve slender fibers, the grid spacing must be on the order of the fiber radius, and thus the number of required grid points along the filament must be of the same order as the aspect ratio. Simulations of slender bodies using the IB method can therefore be intractable. A technique is presented to address this problem in the context of Stokes flow. The velocity of the structure is split into a component coming from the underlying fluid grid, which is coarser than normally required, and a component proportional to the force (a drag term). The drag coefficient is set so that a single sphere is represented exactly on a grid of arbitrary meshwidth. Implicit treatment of the drag term removes some of the stability restrictions normally associated with the IB method. This comes at a loss of accuracy, although tests are conducted that show 1-2 digits of relative accuracy can be obtained on coarser grids. After its accuracy and stability are tested, the method is applied to two real world examples: fibers in shear flow and a suspension of fibers. These examples show that the method can reproduce existing results and make reasonable predictions about the viscosity of an aligned fiber suspension.},

The first is the one provided by the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) energy equations, as interpreted by Osborne Reynolds in the late nineteenth century. The other, much newer framework is that provided by complex dynamical systems. The former gives prominence to the interpretation of local budgets of turbulence kinetic energy while the latter emphasizes the energy flows necessary to maintain turbulence in a statistically-steady state. It is argued that these frameworks constitute two incompatible paradigms, since the first localizes physical interpretation of the RANS kinetic energy budget while the second denies such a simple view. The local interpretation traces back to the way Reynolds himself interpreted his RANS energy equations, which interpretation is examined here and found to be faulty. We present a schematic model for energy flow in convective boundary layers from a complex dynamical systems' perspective, and use it to re-interpret the RANS energy equation.},

  abstract = {Abstract A one-dimensional prognostic model of the atmospheric boundary layer coupled to a surface energy budget is described which utilizes a profile formulation (non-local) for exchange coefficients in the daytime convective boundary layer and an exchange coefficient scheme based on local Richardson number for the stable nocturnal boundary layer. This combined local and non-local model is used to simulate the full diurnal cycle of the boundary-layer behavior of days 33--34 of the Wangara experiment. Results of the simulation indicate that these simplified exchange coefficient schemes simulate the mean features of the boundary layer as well as the more complex and computationally expensive higher order closure models. This diurnal boundary-layer formulation is incorporated into a two-dimensional mesoscale model employing a terrain-following coordinate system to examine boundary-layer behavior over sloping terrain similar to that of the Great Plains of the United States. Particular emphasis is placed on the generation of mesoscale pressure gradients in response to the heated and cooled terrain and the development of low-level wind maxima. Model results and an analysis of thermal wind relationships in the transformed equations indicate the development of a mesoscale thermal wind component to the south during the day throughout the convective boundary layer. At night, the thermal wind component is reversed within the nocturnal boundary layer. The mesoscale thermal wind components in conjunction with the frictional stress profile produce low-level jets in the velocity field both day and night which exceed the synoptic geostrophic speeds.},

  abstract = {Early descriptive models of mountain-valley circulations indicated that the mountain flow (i.e., the along valley axis component out of the valley) is a true three-dimensional phenomenon. According to these descriptions, at night shallow-down slope flows on the valley sidewalls directly driven by temperature deficits near the surface produce a pooling of cool air in the valley. This deep pool of cool air in the valley compared with a much shallower surface inversion over the plains (to which the valley opens) produces a secondary flow (the mountain flow) out of the valley driven by a deep hydrostatic pressure gradient. It is this deep secondary flow which is most important to pollutant transport in deep valleys and which has not been previously investigated in a numerical model. It is the purpose of this investigation to numerically simulate the above-mentioned secondary circulation using a three-dimensional numerical model. The Colorado State University Hydrostatic Mesoscale Model---a hydrostatic, primitive equation model, forced by a surface energy budget---was utilized for the simulations. Both idealized topography and an actual Colorado valley were used in the investigation to emulate the classic mountain-plain configuration discussed above. Special attention was given to the development of the sidewall slope flows which produce the pooling of air in the valley. Results of the simulations indicated shallow slope flows less than 100 m deep started almost immediately after cooling began and reached their maximum velocity after approximately one hour and then slowly decreased through the night. A high level of turbulence was noted near the top of the slope flows. The turbulence was not only due to shear in the slope flow, but to destabilization of the temperature profile because of thermal advection. Definite pooling of cool air occurred in the valley with cooling occurring at all heights to near ridge tops. The secondary flow out of the valley lagged the development of the slope flows by approximately one hour, but was very deep, filling the whole valley to near ridge height.},

Understanding cloud entrainment is difficult given the complexity and diversity of the associated phenomena, which include turbulence entrainment within a stratified medium, convective instabilities driven by radiative and evaporative cooling, shear instabilities, and cloud microphysics. Obtaining accurate data at the required small scales is also challenging, for both simulations and measurements. During the past few decades, however, high-resolution simulations and measurements have greatly advanced our understanding of the main mechanisms controlling cloud entrainment. This article reviews some of these advances, focusing on stratocumulus clouds, and indicates remaining challenges.},

  abstract = {The effect of a linear stratification in the free atmosphere on near-surface properties in a free convective boundary layer (CBL) is investigated by means of direct numerical simulation. We consider two regimes: a neutral stratification regime, which represents a CBL that grows into a residual layer, and a strong stratification regime, which represents the equilibrium (quasi-steady) entrainment regime. We find that the mean buoyancy varies as z-1/3, in agreement with classical similarity theory. However, the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) of the buoyancy fluctuation and the r.m.s. of the vertical velocity vary as z-0.45 and ln z, respectively, both in disagreement with theory. These scaling laws are independent of the stratification regime, but the depth over which they are valid depends on the stratification. In the strong stratification regime, this depth is about 20 to 25 \% of the CBL depth instead of the commonly used 10 \%, which we only observe under neutral conditions. In both regimes, the near-surface flow structure can be interpreted as a hierarchy of circulations attached to the surface. Based on this structure, we define a new near-surface layer in free convection, the plume-merging layer, that is conceptually different from the constant-flux layer. The varying depth of the plume-merging layer depending on the stratification accounts for the varying depth of validity of the scaling laws. These findings imply that the buoyancy transfer law needed in mixed-layer and single-column models is well described by the classical similarity theory, independent of the stratification in the free atmosphere, even though other near-surface properties, such as the r.m.s. of the buoyancy fluctuation and the r.m.s. of the vertical velocity, are inconsistent with that theory.},

One way to assess this sensitivity is through field studies. Another way is through DNS. In particular, DNS can be used to test the hypothesis that LES, even with an inadequate representation of the physics of cloud top entrainment, properly quantifies the sensitivity of cloud-topped boundary layers to changing environmental conditions. We support this argument by contrasting theoretical aspects of both techniques, by presenting first DNS results of a stratocumulus-topped boundary layer and discussing their convergence toward Reynolds number similarity, and by showing the consistency of DNS results with LES results and field measurements.},

  abstract = {The passive scalar field of a temporally evolving shear layer is investigated using gradient trajectories as a means to analyse the scalar probability density function and the conditional scalar dissipation rate in the presence of external intermittency. These results are of significance for turbulent combustion, where improved predictions of the statistics of the conditional dissipation rate are needed in several models. First, the variation of the conventional first and second moments of the conditional dissipation rate across the layer is quantitatively documented in detail. A strong dependence of the conditional dissipation rate on the lateral position and on the conditioning value of the scalar is observed. The dependence on the transverse distance to the centre-plane partially explains the double-hump profile usually reported when this dependence is ignored. The variation with the scalar observed in the ratio between the second and first moments would invalidate certain assumptions commonly done in turbulent combustion. It is also seen that conditioning on the scalar does not reduce the fluctuation of the dissipation rate with respect to unconditional values. Next, the role of external intermittency in these results is investigated. For that purpose, the flow is partitioned into different zones based on different types of gradient trajectories passing through each point, thereby introducing non-local information in comparison with the standard turbulent/non-turbulent separation based on the conventional intermittency function. In addition to the homogeneous outer regions, three zones are identified: a turbulent zone, a turbulence interface and quasi-laminar diffusion layers. The relative contribution from each of these zones to the conventional intermittency factor is reported. The statistics are then conditioned on each of these zones, and the spatial variation of the scalar distribution and of the conditional scalar dissipation rate is explained in terms of the observed zonal statistics. For the Reynolds numbers of the present simulation, between 1500 and 3000 based on the vorticity thickness and the velocity difference, and a Schmidt number equal to 1, it results that the major contribution to both statistics is due to the turbulence interfaces. At the same time, the turbulent zone shows a distinct behaviour, being approximately homogeneous but anisotropic.},

Right underneath the inversion base, a transition or buffer zone is defined based on a strong local conversion of vertical to horizontal motion that leads to a cellular pattern and sheet-like plumes, as observed in cloud measurements and reported in other free-convection problems.

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of free convection over a smooth, heated plate are used to investigate unbounded, unsteady turbulent convection. Four different boundary conditions are considered: free-slip or no-slip walls, and constant buoyancy or constant buoyancy flux. It is first shown that, after the initial transient, the vertical structure agrees with observations in the atmospheric boundary layer and predictions from classical similarity theory. A quasi-steady inner layer and a self-preserving outer layer are clearly distinguished, with an overlap region between them of constant turbulent buoyancy flux. The extension of the overlap region reached in our simulations is more than 100 wall units ({$\kappa$}3/Bs)1/4, where Bs is the surface buoyancy flux and {$\kappa$} the corresponding molecular diffusivity (the Prandtl number is one). The buoyancy fluctuation inside the overlap region already exhibits the -1/3 power-law scaling with height for the four types of boundary conditions, as expected in the local, freeconvection regime. However, the mean buoyancy gradient and the vertical velocity fluctuation are still evolving toward the corresponding power laws predicted by the similarity theory. The second major result is that the relation between the Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers agrees with that reported in Rayleigh--Be{\textasciiacute}nard convection when the heated plate is interpreted as half a convection cell. The range of Rayleigh numbers covered in the simulations is then 5 {\texttimes} 107--109. Further analogies between the two problems indicate that knowledge can be transferred between steady Rayleigh--Be{\textasciiacute}nard and unsteady convection. Last, we find that the inner scaling based on \{Bs, {$\kappa$}\} reduces the effect of the boundary conditions to, mainly, the diffusive wall layer, the first 10 wall units. There, near the plate, free-slip conditions allow stronger mixing than no-slip ones, which results in 30 \% less buoyancy difference between the surface and the overlap region and 30--40 \% thinner diffusive sublayers. However, this local effect also entails one global, substantial effect: with an imposed buoyancy, free-slip systems develop a surface flux 60 \% higher than that obtained with no-slip walls, which implies more intense turbulent fluctuations across the whole boundary layer and a faster growth.},

The CBL is forced by a constant buoyancy flux and grows into a fluid with a constant buoyancy gradient N2 {$\geq$} 0. We study the dependence on N2 of the vertical profiles of the mean and the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) of the buoyancy. We find that, although the mean buoyancy profile varies with height as b {$\propto$} z-1/3 accordingly to the classical similarity theory, the r.m.s. deviates from that theory and varies as brms {$\propto$} z-0.45. It is also found that, despite differences in the large-scale circulations induced by different values of N2, these vertical profiles tend to become independent of N2 near the wall. However, the depth of over which the previous scaling laws are observed increases with N2. Spectral analysis shows that, correspondingly, the nearwall structure becomes increasingly similar among cases as the scale separation between the CBL depth and the surface scale increases.},

The goal is to understand the assumptions intrinsic to this simplified but commonly employed approach for the study of two-layer buoyancy reversing systems like the cloud-top mixing layer. Emphasis is placed on molecular transport phenomena. In particular, a formulation is proposed that recovers the actual nondiffusive liquid-phase continuum as a limiting case of differential diffusion. High-order numerical schemes suitable for direct numerical simulations in the compressible and Boussinesq limits are described, and simulations are presented to validate the incompressible approach. As expected, the Boussinesq approximation provides an accurate and efficient description of the flow on the scales (of the order of meters) that are considered.},

The review starts with the Smagorinsky model, but the focus is on dynamic and similarity subgrid models and on evaluating how well these models reproduce the true impact of the small scales on large-scale physics and how they perform in numerical simulations. Various criteria to evaluate the model performance are discussed, including the so-called a posteriori and a priori studies based on direct numerical simulation and experimental data. Issues are addressed mainly in the context of canonical, incompressible flows, but extensions to scalar-transport, compressible, and reacting flows are also mentioned. Other recent modeling approaches are briefly introduced.},

  abstract = {The Kelvin-Helmholtz model for the formation of surface waves at the interface between two fluids in relative motion is generalized for parallel shear flows. It is assumed that phase changes across the flow are negligible and hence that the aerodynamic pressure on the wave is in phase with its displacement (rather than its slope). A variational formulation is established and leads to the determination of appropriately weighted means for the velocity profiles. The principal application is to flow of a light inviscid fluid over a viscous liquid; it is shown that the principle of exchange of stabilities is applicable to such a configuration, and a critical wind speed in satisfactory agreement with observation is predicted for an air-oil interface. The results also are applied to an air-water interface and lead to the conclusion that Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of such an interface is unlikely at commonly observed wind speeds. A more general formulation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz boundary-value problem and variational principle, allowing for variations in both velocity and density, is given in two appendices.},

Simulated wind speed, turbulent fluxes, spectra and cospectra are assessed in relation to variations in two physical factors, geostrophic wind speed and surface roughness length, and several model configuration choices, including mesh size and grid aspect ratio, turbulence model, and numerical discretization schemes, in three different code bases. Two case studies representing nearly steady neutral and convective atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow conditions over nearly flat and homogeneous terrain were used to force and assess idealized LESs, using periodic lateral boundary conditions. Comparison with fast-response velocity measurements at 10 heights within the lowest 100\&thinsp;m indicates that most model configurations performed similarly overall, with differences between observed and predicted wind speed generally smaller than measurement variability. Simulations of convective conditions produced turbulence quantities and spectra that matched the observations well, while those of neutral simulations produced good predictions of stress, but smaller than observed magnitudes of turbulence kinetic energy, likely due to tower wakes influencing the measurements. While sensitivities to model configuration choices and variability in forcing can be considerable, idealized LESs are shown to reliably reproduce quantities of interest to wind energy applications within the lower ABL during quasi-ideal, nearly steady neutral and convective conditions over nearly flat and homogeneous terrain.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The deformation is uniform in the streamwise direction and spatio-temporally sinusoidal, and its parametric conditions are determined with reference to the mean spatio-temporal scales of the quasi-coherent turbulent structures. The eects of the wall deformation on the skin friction as well as on the statistical quantities and turbulent structures are studied. Among the parameters of the wall deformation, the spanwise wavelength and gradient are more eective for the alterations of the skin friction and statistical quantities. The scales of turbulent structures are found to be dependent on the spanwise wavelength of the wall deformation at both their enhanced and damped phases, whereas a spanwise shift of these structures is observed to be correlated with the time period of deformation. The production of turbulent structures becomes highly intermittent on imposing the wall deformation condition, which is similar to that observed in the temporal evolution of the skin friction coecient as its long-period {\textasciimacron}uctuation. {\'O} 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

A pair of LES-within-LES experiments are performed where a finer-grid LES covering a smaller horizontal domain is nested inside a coarser-grid LES covering a larger horizontal domain. Both LESs are driven under the same environmental conditions, allowed to interact with each other, and expected to behave the same statistically. The first experiment of the free-convective PBL reveals a mean temperature bias between the two LES domains, which generates a nonzero mean vertical velocity in the nest domain while the mean vertical velocity averaged over the outer domain remains zero. The problem occurs when the horizontal extent of the nest domain is too small to capture an adequate sample of energy-containing eddies; this problem can be alleviated using a nest domain that is at least 5 times the PBL depth in both x and y. The second experiment of the neutral PBL exposes a bias in the prediction of the surface stress between the two LES domains, which is found due to the grid dependence of the Smagorinsky-type subgrid-scale (SGS) model. A new two-part SGS model is developed to solve this problem.},

The unsteady version of the problem, which occurs when these forces are not in equilibrium, is solvable analytically only for a limited set of forcing variability regimes, and the resulting solutions are intricate and not always easy to interpret. In this paper, large-eddy simulations (LESs) of neutral atmospheric EBLs are conducted under various unsteady forcings to reveal the range of physical characteristics of the flow. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that the dynamics of the unsteady EBL can be reduced to a second-order ordinary differential equation that is very similar to the dynamical equation of a damped oscillator, such as a mass--spring--damper system. The validation of the proposed reduced model is performed by comparing its analytical solutions to LES results, revealing very good agreement. The reduced model can be solved for a wide range of variable forcing conditions, and this feature is exploited in the paper to elucidate the physical origin of the inertia (mass), energy storage (spring), and energy dissipation (damper) attributes of Ekman flows.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of baroclinic pressure gradients on mean flow and turbulence in the diabatic atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Large-eddy simulations are conducted where the direction of the baroclinicity, its strength, and the surface buoyancy flux are systematically varied to examine their interacting effects. The thermal wind vector, which represents the vertical change in the geostrophic wind vector resulting from horizontal temperature gradients, significantly influences the velocity profiles, the Ekman turning, and the strength and location of the low-level jet (LLJ). For instance, cold advection and positive (negative) geostrophic shear increased (decreased) friction velocity and changed the LLJ elevation. Given the baroclinicity strength and direction under neutral conditions, a simple reduced model is proposed and validated here to predict the general trends of baroclinic mean winds. The baroclinic effects on turbulence intensity and structure are even more intricate, with turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles displaying an increase of TKE magnitude with height for some cases. When a fixed destabilizing surface heat flux is added, a positive geostrophic shear favors streamwise aligned roll-type structures, which are typical of neutral ABLs. Conversely, a negative geostrophic shear promotes cell-type structures, which are typical of strongly unstable ABLs. Furthermore, baroclinicity increases shear in the outer ABL and tends to make the outer flow more neutral by decreasing the Richardson flux number. These findings are consequential for meteorological measurements and the wind-energy industry, among others: baroclinicity alters the mean wind profiles, the TKE, coherent structures, and the stability of the ABL, and its effects need to be considered.},

  abstract = {A new double-moment bulk microphysics scheme predicting the number concentrations and mixing ratios of four hydrometeor species (droplets, cloud ice, rain, snow) is described. New physically based parameterizations are developed for simulating homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation, droplet activation, and the spectral index (width) of the droplet size spectra. Two versions of the scheme are described: one for application in high-resolution cloud models and the other for simulating grid-scale cloudiness in larger-scale models. The versions differ in their treatment of the supersaturation field and droplet nucleation. For the high-resolution approach, droplet nucleation is calculated from Kohler theory applied to a distribution of aerosol that activates at a given supersaturation. The resolved supersaturation field and condensation/deposition rates are predicted using a semianalytic approximation to the three-phase (vapor, ice, liquid) supersaturation equation. For the large-scale version of the scheme, it is assumed that the supersaturation field is not resolved and thus droplet activation is parameterized as a function of the vertical velocity and diabatic cooling rate. The vertical velocity includes a subgrid component that is parameterized in terms of the eddy diffusivity and mixing length. Droplet condensation is calculated using a quasi-steady, saturation adjustment approach. Evaporation/deposition onto the other water species is given by nonsteady vapor diffusion allowing excess vapor density relative to ice saturation.},

Mean predicted cloud boundaries and total cloud fraction compare reasonably well with observations. Cloud phase partitioning, which is crucial in determining the surface radiative fluxes, is fairly similar to ground-based retrievals. However, the fraction of time that liquid is present in the column is somewhat underpredicted, leading to small biases in the downwelling shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes at the surface. Results using the new scheme are compared to parallel simulations using other microphysics parameterizations of varying complexity. The predicted liquid water path and cloud phase is significantly improved using the new scheme relative to a single-moment parameterization predicting only the mixing ratio of the water species. Results indicate that a realistic treatment of cloud ice number concentration (prognosing rather than diagnosing) is needed to simulate arctic clouds. Sensitivity tests are also performed by varying the aerosol size, solubility, and number concentration to explore potential cloud--aerosol--radiation interactions in arctic stratus.},

The microphysics scheme predicts the number concentrations and mixing ratios of four hydrometeor species (cloud droplets, small ice, rain, snow) and includes detailed treatments of droplet activation and ice nucleation from a prescribed distribution of aerosol obtained from observations. The model is able to reproduce many features of the observed mixed-phase cloud, including a near-adiabatic liquid water content profile located near the top of a well-mixed boundary layer, droplet number concentrations of about 200--250 cmϪ3 that were distributed fairly uniformly through the depth of the cloud, and continuous light snow falling from the cloud base to the surface. The impacts of droplet and ice nucleation, radiative transfer, turbulence, large-scale dynamics, and vertical resolution on the simulated mixed-phase stratiform cloud are examined. The cloud layer is largely self-maintained through strong cloud-top radiative cooling that exceeds 40 K dayϪ1. It persists through extended periods of downward large-scale motion that tend to thin the layer and reduce water contents. Droplet activation rates are highest near cloud base, associated with subgrid vertical motion that is diagnosed from the predicted turbulence kinetic energy. A sensitivity test neglecting subgrid vertical velocity produces only weak activation and small droplet number concentrations (Ͻ90 cmϪ3). These results highlight the importance of parameterizing the impact of subgrid vertical velocity to generate local supersaturation for aerosol-droplet closure. The primary ice nucleation mode in the simulated mixed-phase cloud is contact freezing of droplets. Sensitivity tests indicate that the assumed number and size of contact nuclei can have a large impact on the evolution and characteristics of mixed-phase cloud, especially the partitioning of condensate between droplets and ice.},

Meandering and non-meandering cases are identified through analysis of the Eulerian autocorrelation functions of the horizontal windvelocity components and temperature. When all three autocorrelation functions oscillate, meandering is present. As with weak turbulence, meandering shows no dependence on stability but is influenced by presence of buildings and depends on wind speed. We show that, while the standard deviation of the horizontal velocity is always large in low-wind conditions, the standard deviation of the vertical velocity shows very different behaviour in meandering and non-meandering conditions. In particular, the value of the ratio of the standard deviations of the vertical and horizontal velocities typifies the meandering condition.},

  abstract = {Abstract Oscillations in the horizontal components of the wind velocity associated with oscillations in air temperature during low--wind speed episodes are ubiquitous in the stable boundary layer and are labeled as wind meandering. The meandering structure is recognizable by a clear negative lobe in the Eulerian autocorrelation functions of the horizontal wind velocity components and of the sonic temperature and by a corresponding peak at low frequency in the velocity components and temperature spectra. These distinctive features are used to isolate meandering occurrences and to study its properties in relation to the classical description of the planetary stable boundary layer. It is shown that the ratio of the variance of the wind velocity vertical component over the variance of the composite of the wind velocity horizontal components splits the frequency distribution of meandering and nonmeandering events and divides the nocturnal boundary layer in two different regimes characterized by different turbulent properties. The data comparison with a turbulence model based on Rotta return to isotropy showed that meandering and nonmeandering cases may have similar dynamics. This suggests that meandering may not be connected to a laminarization of the flow and shows that the Rotta scheme may still describe the energetic transfer between wind velocity components in the very stable boundary layer if the Rotta similarity constant c depends on the flux Richardson number. The data confirm a c value of 2.2 for Rif = 0 compatible with its conventional value. The analysis presented refers to one year of continuous measurements on 10 levels carried out at a coastal site in southeastern Brazil.},

  abstract = {Theories of convection from maintained and instantaneous sources of buoyancy are developed, using methods which are applicable to stratified body fluids with any variation of density with height; detailed solutions have been presented for the case of a stably stratified fluid with a linear density gradient. The three main assumptions involved are (i) that the profiles of vertical velocity and buoyancy are similar at all heights, (ii) that the rate of entrainment of fluid at any height is proportional to a characteristic velocity at that height, and (iii) that the fluids are incompressible and do not change volume on mixing, and that local variations in density throughout the motion are small compared to some reference density. The governing equations are derived in non-dimensional form from the conditions of conservation of volume, momentum and buoyancy, and a numerical solution is obtained for the case of the maintained source, This leads to a prediction of the final height to which a plume of light fluid will rise in a stably stratified fluid. Estimates of the constant governing the rate of entrainment are made by comparing the theory with some previous results in uniform fluids, and with the results of new experiments carried out in a stratified salt solution. For the case of an instantaneous source of buoyancy there is an exact solution; the entrainment constant is again estimated from laboratory results for a stratified fluid Finally, the analysis is applied to the (compressible) atmosphere, by making the customary substitution of potential temperature for temperature. Predictions are made of the height to which smoke plumes from typical sources of heat should rise in a still, stably stratified atmosphere under various conditions.},

  abstract = {The applicability of the one-way nesting technique for numerical simulations of the heterogeneous atmospheric boundary layer using the large-eddy simulation (LES) framework of the Weather Research and Forecasting model is investigated. The focus of this study is on LES of offshore convective boundary layers. Simulations were carried out using two subgrid-scale models (linear and non-linear) with two different closures [diagnostic and prognostic subgrid-scale turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equations]. We found that the nonlinear backscatter and anisotropy model with a prognostic subgrid-scale TKE equation is capable of providing similar results when performing one-way nested LES to a stand-alone domain having the same grid resolution but using periodic lateral boundary conditions. A good agreement is obtained in terms of velocity shear and turbulent fluxes, while velocity variances are overestimated. A streamwise fetch of 14 km is needed following each domain transition in order for the solution to reach quasi-stationary results and for the velocity spectra to generate proper energy content at high wavelengths, however, a pile-up of energy is observed at the low-wavelength portion of the spectrum on the first nested domain. The inclusion of a second nest with higher resolution allows the solution to reach effective grid spacing well within the Kolmogorov inertial subrange of turbulence and develop an appropriate energy cascade that eliminates most of the pile-up of energy at low wavelengths. Consequently, the overestimation of velocity variances is substantially reduced and a considerably better agreement with respect to the stand-alone domain results is achieved.},

The results are based on eddy-covariance data collected during the Slope Experiment near La Fouly (SELF-2010); a field campaign conducted in a narrow valley of the Swiss Alps during summer 2010. The turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum are found to vary significantly with height in the first few metres above the inclined surface. These variations exceed by an order of magnitude the well-accepted maximum 10~\% required for the applicability of Monin--Obukhov similarity theory in the surface layer. This could be due to a surface layer that is too thin to be detected or to the presence of advective fluxes. It is shown that local scaling can be a useful tool in these cases when surface-layer theory breaks down. Under convective conditions and after removing the effects of self-correlation, the normalized standard deviations of slope-normal wind velocity, temperature and humidity scale relatively well with \$\$z/{\textbackslash}varLambda \$\$, where \$\$z\$\$is the measurement height and \$\${\textbackslash}varLambda (z)\$\$the local Obukhov length. However, the horizontal velocity fluctuations are not correlated with \$\$z/{\textbackslash}varLambda \$\$under all stability regimes. The non-dimensional gradients of wind velocity and temperature are also investigated. For those, the local scaling appears inappropriate, particularly at night when shallow drainage flows prevail and lead to negative wind-speed gradients close to the surface.},

In order to ensure the realizability for the improved M--Y Level-3 model and its numerical stability, restrictions are imposed on computing stability functions, on L/q, the temperature and water-content variances, and their covariance, where L is the master length scale and q2/2 the turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass. The model with these restrictions predicts vertical profiles of mean quantities such as temperature that are in good agreement with those obtained from large-eddy simulation of a radiation fog. In a regional prediction, it also reasonably reproduces the satellite-observed horizontal distribution of an advection fog.},

  abstract = {A parameterization of gravity wave stress generated by subgrid-scale topography is described and tested in a onedimensional version of the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) model. It is argued that in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) where wave reflections occur, the so-called WKB method for evaluating wave stress may not be applicable. Gravity waves launched by a subgrid-scale Gaussian ridge are calculated on line using a linear wave model. The total flow is constrained to be convectively stable by using a terrain-height adjustment to decrease wave amplitudes and thereby prevent wave overturning. In this method when the waves grow large enough to overturn, the wave amplitudes are decreased by decreasing the maximum height of the terrain obstacle, H: At each time step, the ARPS model flow is modified by the divergence of the wave stress. The effects of wave-stress divergence on turbulence parameterization is examined using three turbulence closure schemes, K-theory with constant eddy diffusivity, the Smagorinsky closure, and the turbulence-kinetic energy closure. Also, the effects of vertical grid spacing are tested using spacings of 10, 20, 50 and 100 m: The model is initialized with a hyperbolic-tangent wind profile and constant Brunt--Va.isa.la. frequency. It is shown that wave-stress divergence can lead to elevated layers of turbulence and diffusion where they would not occur in the absence of the wave-stress parameterization. It is also shown that if the vertical grid spacing is too great, then the effects of wave breaking are not fully realized.},

  abstract = {In the early 1960s, it was established that the stochastic initial value problem for weakly coupled wave systems has a natural asymptotic closure induced by the dispersive properties of the waves and the large separation of linear and nonlinear time scales. One is thereby led to kinetic equations for the redistribution of spectral densities via three- and four-wave resonances together with a nonlinear renormalization of the frequency. The kinetic equations have equilibrium solutions which are much richer than the familiar thermodynamic, Fermi--Dirac or Bose--Einstein spectra and admit in addition finite flux (Kolmogorov--Zakharov) solutions which describe the transfer of conserved densities (e.g. energy) between sources and sinks. There is much one can learn from the kinetic equations about the behavior of particular systems of interest including insights in connection with the phenomenon of intermittency. What we would like to convince you is that what we call weak or wave turbulence is every bit as rich as the macho turbulence of 3D hydrodynamics at high Reynolds numbers and, moreover, is analytically more tractable. It is an excellent paradigm for the study of many-body Hamiltonian systems which are driven far from equilibrium by the presence of external forcing and damping. In almost all cases, it contains within its solutions behavior which invalidates the premises on which the theory is based in some spectral range. We give some new results concerning the dynamic breakdown of the weak turbulence description and discuss the fully nonlinear and intermittent behavior which follows. These results may also be important for proving or disproving the global existence of solutions for the underlying partial differential equations. Wave turbulence is a subject to which many have made important contributions. But no contributions have been more fundamental than those of Volodja Zakharov whose 60th birthday we celebrate at this meeting. He was the first to appreciate that the kinetic equations admit a far richer class of solutions than the fluxless thermodynamic solutions of equilibrium systems and to realize the central roles that finite flux solutions play in non-equilibrium systems. It is appropriate, therefore, that we call these Kolmogorov--Zakharov (KZ) spectra. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We consider a model for the stable atmospheric boundary at large stability, i.e. near the limit where turbulence is no longer able to survive. The model is a plane horizontally homogeneous channel flow, which is driven by a constant pressure gradient and which has a noslip wall at the bottom and a free-slip wall at the top. At the lower wall a constant negative temperature flux is imposed. First, we consider a direct numerical simulation of the same channel flow. The simulation is computed with the neutral channel flow as initial condition and computed as a function of time for various values of the stability parameter h=L, where h is the channel height and L is related to the Obukhov length. We find that a turbulent solution is only possible for h=L {$<$} 1:25 and for larger values turbulence decays. Next, we consider a theoretical model for this channel flow based on a simple gradient transfer closure. The resulting equations allow an exact solution for the case of a stationary flow. The velocity profile for this solution is almost linear as a function of height in most of the channel. In the limit of infinite Reynolds number, the temperature profile has a logarithmic singularity at the upper wall of the channel. For the cases where a turbulent flow is maintained in the numerical simulation, we find that the velocity and temperature profiles are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical model when the effects of the surface layer on the exchange coefficients are taken into account.},

The fourth spatial coordinate is introduced formally to be homogeneous and mathematically orthogonal to the others, similar to the spanwise coordinate. Exponential growth of small 4D perturbations superimposed onto 3D turbulent solutions was observed in the Reynolds number range from Re = 4000 to Re = 10 000. The growth rate of small 4D perturbations expressed in wall units was found to be {$\lambda$}+4D = 0.016 independent of Reynolds number. Nonlinear evolution of 4D perturbations leads either to attenuation of turbulence and relaminarization or to establishment of a self-sustained 4D turbulent solution (4D turbulent flow). Both results on flow evolution were obtained at the lowest Reynolds number, depending on the grid resolution, pointing to the proximity of Re = 4000 as the critical Reynolds number for 4D turbulence. Self-sustained 4D turbulence appeared to be less intense compared with 3D turbulence in terms of mean wall friction, which is about 55 \% of that predicted by the empirical Dean law for turbulent channel flow at all Reynolds numbers considered. Thus, the law of resistance of 4D turbulent channel flow can be expressed as Cf = 0.04Re-0.25.},

  abstract = {Modifications of the widely used K-profile model of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), reported by Troen and Mahrt (TM) in 1986, are proposed and their effects examined by comparison with large eddy simulation (LES) data. The modifications involve three parts. First, the heat flux from the entrainment at the inversion layer is incorporated into the heat and momentum profiles, and it is used to predict the growth of the PBL directly. Second, profiles of the velocity scale and the Prandtl number in the PBL are proposed, in contrast to the constant values used in the TM model. Finally, non-local mixing of momentum was included. The results from the new PBL model and the original TM model are compared with LES data. The TM model was found to give too high PBL heights in the PBL with strong shear, and too low heights for the convection-dominated PBL, which causes unrealistic heat flux profiles. The new PBL model improves the predictability of the PBL height and produces profiles that are more realistic. Moreover, the new PBL model produces more realistic profiles of potential temperature and velocity. We also investigated how each of these three modifications affects the results, and found that explicit representation of the entrainment rate is the most critical.},

We have developed a method for mapping sea ice surface roughness using angular reflectance data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and lidar-derived roughness measurements from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). Using an empirical data modeling approach, we derived estimates of Arctic sea ice roughness ranging from centimeters to decimeters within the MISR 275-m pixel size. Using independent ATM data for validation, we find that histograms of lidar and multi-angular roughness values were nearly identical for areas with a roughness {$<$} 20 cm, but for rougher regions, the MISR-estimated roughness had a narrower range of values than the ATM data. The algorithm was able to accurately identify areas that transition between smooth and rough ice. Because of its coarser spatial scale, MISR-estimated roughness data have a variance about half that of ATM roughness data.},

  abstract = {The authors describe the Lagrangian cloud simulator (LCS), which simulates droplet growth in air turbulence. The LCS adopts the Euler--Lagrangian framework and can provide reference data for cloud microphysical models by tracking the growth of particles individually. The collisional growth in a stagnant flow is calculated by the LCS and also by solving the stochastic collision--coalescence equation (SCE). Good agreement is obtained between the LCS and SCE simulations. Comparisons between the results for stagnant and turbulent flows confirm that in-cloud turbulence enhances collisional growth. The enhancement is well predicted by the SCE method if a proper collision model is employed. To quantify the enhancement, the paper defines the time scale of the autoconversion process, in which cloud droplets grow into raindrops through collisions, as the time taken for 10\% of the cloud to become rain (t10\%). The authors then define the turbulence enhancement factor Eturb as Eturb 5 t10\%[NoT]/t10\%[T], where the overbar denotes the mean value of the LCS runs and the subscripts NoT and T indicate stagnant (nonturbulent) flow and turbulent flow simulations, respectively. It was found that the enhancement factor increases linearly with the energy dissipation rate, while it does not show a consistent dependence on the Reynolds number. The levels of statistical fluctuations in the autoconversion time scales were directly obtained for the first time. It is shown that the relative standard deviation of t10\% simply follows the power law that the binomial distribution theory predicts, independently of the flow conditions.},

  abstract = {Using a Large-Eddy Simulation model, we have systematically studied the inability of boundary layer turbulence to efficiently mix reactive species. This creates regions where the species are accumulated in a correlated or anti-correlated way, thereby modifying the mean reactivity. We quantify this modification by the intensity of segregation, IS, and analyse the driving mechanisms: heterogeneity of the surface moisture and heat fluxes, various background wind patterns and non-uniform isoprene emissions. The heterogeneous surface conditions are characterized by cool and wet forested patches with high isoprene emissions, alternated with warm and dry patches that represents pasture with relatively low isoprene emissions. For typical conditions in the Amazon rain forest, applying homogeneous surface forcings and in the absence of free tropospheric NOx, the isopreneOH reaction rate is altered by less than 10 \%. This is substantially smaller than the previously assumed IS of 50 \% in recent large-scale model analyses of tropical rain forest chemistry. Spatial heterogeneous surface emissions enhance the segregation of species, leading to alterations of the chemical reaction rates up to 20 \%. The intensities of segregation are enhanced when the background wind direction is parallel to the borders between the patches and reduced in the case of a perpendicular wind direction. The effects of segregation on trace gas concentrations vary per species. For the highly reactive OH, the differences in concentration averaged over the boundary layer are less than 2 \% compared to homogeneous surface conditions, while the isoprene concentration is increased by as much as 12 \% due to the reduced chemical reaction rates. These processes take place at the sub-grid scale of chemistry transport models and therefore need to be parameterized.},

It transforms pure gravity waves into gravito-inertial waves that have a larger amplitude closer to the equator, and it introduces new waves whose restoring force is mainly the conservation of vorticity. Conclusions. Taking the Coriolis acceleration into account changes the subtle balance between prograde and retrograde waves in nonrotating stars. It also introduces new types of waves that are either purely prograde or retrograde. We show in this paper where the local deposition of angular momentum by such waves is important.},

  abstract = {The summertime Great Plains low-level jet (LLJ) has been the subject of numerous investigations during the past several decades. Characteristics of the LLJ include nighttime development of a pronounced wind maximum of typically 15--20 m s21 at levels 300--800 m above the surface and a clockwise rotation of the wind maximum during the course of the night. Maximum frequency of occurrence of the LLJ is found in the southern Great Plains. Theories proposed to explain the diurnal wind maximum of the Great Plains LLJ include inertial oscillation of the ageostrophic wind, the diurnal oscillation of the horizontal pressure field associated with heating and cooling of the sloping terrain, and the western boundary current interpretations. A simple equation system and output from the 12-km horizontal resolution Weather Research and Forecasting Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NAM) for July 2008 are used to provide evidence as to the importance of the Great Plains topography in driving the LLJ. Summertime heating of the sloping terrain is critical in establishing the climatological position for the Great Plains LLJ. Heating enhances the background geostrophic flow associated with the Bermuda high, resulting in a maximum low-level mean summertime flow over the Great Plains region. Maximum geostrophic winds in the NAM are found during late afternoon, providing a large background wind on which frictional decoupling can act. The nighttime LLJ maximum is the result of an inertial oscillation of the unbalanced components that arise fundamentally from frictional decoupling. Diurnal heating of the sloping terrain forces a cycle in the geostrophic wind that is out of phase with the wind maximum.},

  abstract = {This manuscript describes numerical experiments investigating the influence of 2--30-km striplike heterogeneity on wet and dry convective boundary layers coupled to the land surface. The striplike heterogeneity is shown to dramatically alter the structure of the convective boundary layer by inducing significant organized circulations that modify turbulent statistics. The impact, strength, and extent of the organized motions depend critically on the scale of the heterogeneity ␭ relative to the boundary layer height zi. The coupling with the land surface modifies the surface fluxes and hence the circulations resulting in some differences compared to previous studies using fixed surface forcing. Because of the coupling, surface fluxes in the middle of the patches are small compared to the patch edges. At large heterogeneity scales (␭/zi ϳ18) horizontal surface-flux gradients within each patch are strong enough to counter the surface-flux gradients between wet and dry patches allowing the formation of small cells within the patch coexisting with the large-scale patch-induced circulations. The strongest patch-induced motions occur in cases with 4 Ͻ ␭/zi Ͻ 9 because of strong horizontal pressure gradients across the wet and dry patches. Total boundary layer turbulence kinetic energy increases significantly for surface heterogeneity at scales between ␭/zi ϭ 4 and 9; however, entrainment rates for all cases are largely unaffected by the striplike heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {A range of large-eddy simulations, with differing free atmosphere stratification and zero or slightly positive surface heat flux, is investigated to improve understanding of the neutral and near-neutral, inversion-capped, horizontally homogeneous, barotropic atmospheric boundary layer with emphasis on the upper region. We find that an adjustment time of at least 16 h is needed for the simulated flow to reach a quasi-steady state. The boundary layer continues to grow, but at a slow rate that changes little after 8 h of simulation time. A common feature of the neutral simulations is the development of a super-geostrophic jet near the top of the boundary layer. The analytical wind-shear models included do not account for such a jet, and the best agreement with simulated wind shear is seen in cases with weak stratification above the boundary layer. Increasing the surface heat flux decreases the magnitude and vertical extent of the jet and leads to better agreement between analytical and simulated wind-speed profiles. Over a range of different inversion strengths and surface heat fluxes, we also find good agreement between the performed simulations and models of the equilibrium boundary-layer height, and of the budget of turbulent kinetic energy integrated across the boundary layer.},

  abstract = {An experiment to investigate atmospheric turbulence was performed at Concordia station (Dome C, Antarctica) during winter 2012, finding significant turbulence in a near-surface layer extending to heights of a few tens of metres, despite the strong stable stratification. The spatial and temporal behaviour of thermal turbulence is examined using a high-resolution sodar, starting from the lowest few metres with a vertical resolution better than 2 m. Sodar observations are complemented by in situ measurements using a weather station and radiometers near the surface, temperature and wind-speed sensors at six levels on a 45-m tower, and radiosondes. The depth of the surface-based turbulent layer (SBTL) at Dome C during the whole winter is directly measured experimentally for the first time, and has an average depth of {$\approx$} 23 m, varying from a few to several tens of metres, while the inversion-layer depth {$\approx$} 380 m. Relationships between the depth of the SBTL and atmospheric parameters such as the temperature, wind speed, longwave radiation, Brunt--V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and Richardson number are shown. The SBTL under steady weather conditions is analyzed and classified into three prevailing types: (i) a very shallow layer with a depth {$<$} 15 m, (ii) a shallow layer of depth 15--70 m with uniform internal structure, (iii) a shallow layer of depth 20--70 m with waves. Wave activity in the SBTL is observed during a significant portion of the time, with sometimes regular (with periodicity of 8--15 min) trains of Kelvin--Helmholtz billow-like waves occurring at periods of 20--60 s, and lasting several hours.},

The high-dimensional quantum reservoir dynamics are established by universal quantum gates that rotate and entangle the individual qubits of the tensor product quantum state. A comparison of the quantum reservoir computing model with its classical counterpart shows that the same prediction and reconstruction capabilities of classical reservoirs with thousands of perceptrons can be obtained by a few strongly entangled qubits. We demonstrate that the mean squared error between model output and ground truth in the test phase of the quantum reservoir computing algorithm increases when the reservoir is decomposed into separable subsets of qubits. Furthermore, the quantum reservoir computing model is implemented on a real noisy IBM quantum computer for up to seven qubits. Our work thus opens the door to model the dynamics of classical complex systems in a high-dimensional phase space effectively with an algorithm that requires a small number of qubits.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the stable boundary layer, thermal submesofronts (TSFs) are detected during the Shallow Cold Pool experiment in the Colorado plains, Colorado, USA in 2012. The topography induces TSFs by forming two different air layers converging on the valley-side wall while being stacked vertically above the valley bottom. The warm-air layer is mechanically generated by lee turbulence that consistently elevates near-surface temperatures, while the cold-air layer is thermodynamically driven by radiative cooling and the corresponding cold-air drainage decreases near-surface temperatures. The semi-stationary TSFs can only be detected, tracked, and investigated in detail when using fibre-optic distributed sensing (FODS), as point observations miss TSFs most of the time. Neither the occurrence of TSFs nor the characteristics of each air layer are connected to a specific wind or thermal regime. However, each air layer is characterized by a specific relationship between the wind speed and the friction velocity. Accordingly, a single threshold separating different flow regimes within the boundary layer is an oversimplification, especially during the occurrence of TSFs. No local forcings or their combination could predict the occurrence of TSFs except that they are less likely to occur during stronger near-surface or synoptic-scale flow. While classical conceptualizations and techniques of the boundary layer fail in describing the formation of TSFs, the use of spatially continuous data obtained from FODS provide new insights. Future studies need to incorporate spatially continuous data in the horizontal and vertical planes, in addition to classic sensor networks of sonic anemometry and thermohygrometers to fully characterize and describe boundary-layer phenomena.},

The submesoscale motion consisted of two air layers creating a well-defined front with a sharp temperature gradient, and further-on referred to as a thermal submesofront (TSF). The semi-stationary TSFs and their advective velocities are detected and determined by the fibre-optic distributed-sensing~(FODS) technique. An objective detection algorithm utilizing FODS measurements is able to detect the TSF boundary, which enables a detailed investigation of its spatio--temporal statistics. The novel approach in data processing is to conditionally average any parameter depending on the distance between a TSF boundary and the measurement location. By doing this, a spatially-distributed feature like TSFs can be characterized by point observations and processes at the TSF boundary can be investigated. At the TSF boundary, the air layers converge, creating an updraft, strong static stability, and vigorous mixing. Further, the TSF advective velocity of TSFs is an order of magnitude lower than the mean wind speed. Despite being gentle, the topography plays an important role in TSF formation. Details on generating mechanisms and implications of TSFs on the stable boundary layer are discussed in Part 2.},

  abstract = {Abstract A study is made of the hydrostatic and quasi-geostrophic motion of two superimposed layers of homogeneous and incompressible fluids of different densities, these fluids being contained between two rigid, horizontal plates. It is found that the local time derivatives of the pressure heights in the two layers and the height of their interface can be determined from partial differential equations similar to those developed by Charney for the equivalent-barotropic model. The possibility of using this two-layer model to represent motions of a continuously stratified, baroclinic troposphere is explored by comparing the behavior of small perturbations superimposed on a zonal current in the two-layer model with the results of the continuous baroclinic perturbation theories of Eady and Fj{\o}rtoft. The remarkable similarity of behavior of the two-layer and the continuous perturbation models, which appears from this comparison, suggests that if the initial flow patterns of the two-layer model are determined from the initial flow patterns of the troposphere in a specified manner the later flow patterns in the troposphere can be inferred from the forecast flow patterns of the two-layer model. This hypothesis is subjected to a preliminary test by computing the instantaneous sea-level pressure tendencies and vertical motions (in the middle troposphere) at the beginning of the severe storm of 24--25 November 1950 over eastern North America. The order of magnitude of the predicted quantities and their general distribution agree in many respects with the observed pressure changes and hydrometeors, but some disagreement exists. It is suggested that a part of this disagreement may be due to the effect of large normal accelerations on the validity of the quasi-geostrophic assumption.},

It is shown that the mean square velocity normal to the plane is equal to the sum of the mean squares of the velocities in the other two orthogonal directions. The asymptotic variations with distance normal to the plane are found for functions representing the important properties of the motion, and, in particular, the energy of the fluctuations is shown to be inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance from the plane.

Two different representations of the entrainment zone, each of which has a different closure of the entrainment heat flux, are considered. The simpler of the two is based on a sharp discontinuity at the inversion (zeroth-order jump), whereas the second one prescribes a finite depth of the inversion zone (first-order jump). Large-eddy simulation data are used to provide the initial conditions for the mixed-layer models, and to verify their results. Two different atmospheric boundary layers with different stratification in the free atmosphere are analyzed. It is shown that, despite the simplicity of the zeroth-order-jump model, it provides similar results to the first-order-jump model and can reproduce the evolution of the mixed-layer variables obtained by the large-eddy simulations in sheared convective boundary layers. The mixed-layer model with both closures compares better with the large-eddy simulation results in the atmospheric boundary layer characterized by a moderate wind shear and a weak temperature inversion. These results can be used to represent the flux of momentum, heat, and other scalars at the entrainment zone in general circulation or chemistry transport models.},

  abstract = {We study passive scalars in turbulent plane channels at computationally high Reynolds number, thus allowing us to observe previously unnoticed effects. The mean scalar profiles are found to obey a generalized logarithmic law which includes a linear correction term in the whole lower half-channel, and they follow a universal parabolic defect profile in the core region. This is consistent with recent findings regarding the mean velocity profiles in channel flow. The scalar variances also exhibit a near universal parabolic distribution in the core flow and hints of a sizeable log layer, unlike the velocity variances. The energy spectra highlight the formation of large scalar-bearing eddies with size proportional to the channel height which are caused by a local production excess over dissipation, and which are clearly visible in the flow visualizations. Close correspondence of the momentum and scalar eddies is observed, with the main difference being that the latter tend to form sharper gradients, which translates into higher scalar dissipation. Another notable Reynolds number effect is the decreased correlation of the passive scalar field with the vertical velocity field, which is traced to the reduced effectiveness of ejection events.},

They have important impacts on both radiative and turbulent heat fluxes and partly determine local climate-change feedbacks. Understanding the spread in inversion strength modelled by current global climate models is therefore an important step in better understanding Arctic climate and its present and future changes. Here, we show how the formation of Arctic air masses leads to the emergence of a cloudy and a clear state of the Arctic winter boundary layer. In the cloudy state, cloud liquid water is present, little to no surface radiative cooling occurs and inversions are elevated and relatively weak, whereas surface radiative cooling leads to strong surface-based temperature inversions in the clear state. Comparing model output to observations, we find that most climate models lack a realistic representation of the cloudy state. An idealised single-column model experiment of the formation of Arctic air reveals that this bias is linked to inadequate mixedphase cloud microphysics, whereas turbulent and conductive heat fluxes control the strength of inversions within the clear state.},

However, detrimental impacts of more realistic schemes on the large-scale flow have hindered progress in this area. Here we implement a total turbulent energy scheme into the climate model ECHAM6. The total turbulent energy scheme considers the effects of Earth's rotation and static stability on the turbulence length scale. In contrast to the previously used turbulence scheme, the TTE scheme also implicitly represents entrainment flux in a dry convective boundary layer. Reducing the previously exaggerated surface drag in stable boundary layers indeed causes an increase in southern hemispheric zonal winds and large-scale pressure gradients beyond observed values. These biases can be largely removed by increasing the parametrized orographic drag. Reducing the neutral limit turbulent Prandtl number warms and moistens low-latitude boundary layers and acts to reduce longstanding radiation biases in the stratocumulus regions, the Southern Ocean and the equatorial cold tongue that are common to many climate models.},

  abstract = {The land surface is a key component of climate models. It controls the partitioning of available energy at the surface between sensible and latent heat, and it controls the partitioning of available water between evaporation and runoff. The land surface is also the location of the terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence is increasing that the influence of the land surface is significant on climate and that changes in the land surface can influence regional- to global-scale climate on time scales from days to millennia. Further, there is now a suggestion that the terrestrial carbon sink may decrease as global temperatures increase as a consequence of rising CO2 levels. This paper provides the theoretical background that explains why the land surface should play a central role in climate. It also provides evidence, sourced from climate model experiments, that the land surface is of central importance. This paper then reviews the development of land surface models designed for climate models from the early, very simple models through to recent efforts, which include a coupling of biophysical processes to represent carbon exchange. It is pointed out that significant problems remain to be addressed, including the difficulties in parameterizing hydrological processes, root processes, sub-grid-scale heterogeneity and biogeochemical cycles. It is argued that continued development of land surface models requires more multidisciplinary efforts by scientists with a wide range of skills. However, it is also argued that the framework is now in place within the international community to build and maintain the latest generation of land surface models. Further, there should be considerable optimism that consolidating the recent rapid advances in land surface modelling will enhance our capability to simulate the impacts of land-cover change and the impacts of increasing CO2 on the global and regional environment.

A long-term study of the mast data for the years 2016 and 2017 demonstrates a clear dependence of stability on the wind direction. Stable conditions are predominantly expected during southerly winds coming from the land. The analysis of various stability and turbulence criteria shows that the lapse rate is the most robust parameter for stability classification in the German Bight, but further implies that stability depends on the measurement height. A near-surface (0 to 30~m), predominantly convective, layer is present and more stable conditions are found aloft (55 to 95~m). Combing the stability data with the airborne measurements of the offshore wind-farm wakes reveals the trend of a correlation between longer wake lengths and an increase in the initial wind-speed deficit downwind of a wind farm with stronger thermal stability. However, the stability correlation criteria with the wake length downstream of the four investigated wind farms, Godewind, Amrumbank West, Meerwind S{\"u}d/Ost, and Nordsee Ost, contain large variance. It is assumed that the observed scattering is due to the influence of the wind-farm architecture and temperature inversions around hub height. These, however, are crucial for the classification of stability and illustrate the complexity of a clear stability metric.},

As described in Part I, the land surface model includes explicit soil moisture, which is based on the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere (ISBA) model, and three pathways for evaporation: soil evaporation, evaporation from the wet canopy, and vegetative transpiration. The data assimilation scheme presented here also follows similar work on data assimilation for ISBA and uses model biases of the 2-m air temperature and humidity against observed analyses to nudge soil moisture. An important difference from the ISBA schemes is that the nudging strengths are computed from model parameters such as solar radiation, temperature, leaf area, vegetation coverage, and aerodynamic resistance rather than from statistically derived functions. The rationale is that nudging soil moisture according to model biases in air temperature and humidity should depend on the degree of coupling across the land--atmosphere interface. Thus, nudging strengths are designed to reflect the potential for the surface and root-zone soil moisture to affect near-surface air temperature and humidity. Model test cases are used to examine relationships between the nudging strengths and modeled physical parameters and then to demonstrate the effects of the nudging scheme on model results.},

In addition, it has been in use in a mesoscale meteorological model for several years. For stable conditions, a very simple scheme is presented that compares well to the iterative solution. The stable scheme includes a very stable regime in which the slope of the stability functions is reduced to permit significant fluxes to occur, which is particularly important for numerical models in which decoupling from the surface can be an important problem. For unstable conditions, simple schemes generalized for varying ratios of aerodynamic roughness to thermal roughness (z0/z0h) are less satisfactory. Therefore, a simple scheme has been empirically derived for a fixed z0/z0h ratio, which represents quasi-laminar sublayer resistance.},

  abstract = {The modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer during convective conditions has long been a major source of uncertainty in the numerical modeling of meteorological conditions and air quality. Much of the difficulty stems from the large range of turbulent scales that are effective in the convective boundary layer (CBL). Both small-scale turbulence that is subgrid in most mesoscale grid models and large-scale turbulence extending to the depth of the CBL are important for the vertical transport of atmospheric properties and chemical species. Eddy diffusion schemes assume that all of the turbulence is subgrid and therefore cannot realistically simulate convective conditions. Simple nonlocal closure PBL models, such as the Blackadar convective model that has been a mainstay PBL option in the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University--National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) for many years and the original asymmetric convective model (ACM), also an option in MM5, represent large-scale transport driven by convective plumes but neglect small-scale, subgrid turbulent mixing. A new version of the ACM (ACM2) has been developed that includes the nonlocal scheme of the original ACM combined with an eddy diffusion scheme. Thus, the ACM2 is able to represent both the supergrid- and subgrid-scale components of turbulent transport in the convective boundary layer. Testing the ACM2 in one-dimensional form and comparing it with large-eddy simulations and field data from the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere--Surface Exchange Study demonstrates that the new scheme accurately simulates PBL heights, profiles of fluxes and mean quantities, and surface-level values. The ACM2 performs equally well for both meteorological parameters (e.g., potential temperature, moisture variables, and winds) and trace chemical concentrations, which is an advantage over eddy diffusion models that include a nonlocal term in the form of a gradient adjustment.},

  abstract = {A new combined local and nonlocal closure atmospheric boundary layer model called the Asymmetric Convective Model, version 2, (ACM2) was described and tested in one-dimensional form and was compared with large-eddy simulations and field data in Part I. Herein, the incorporation of the ACM2 into the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University--NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) is described. Model simulations using the MM5 with the ACM2 are made for the summer of 2004 and evaluated through comparison with surface meteorological measurements, rawinsonde profile measurements, and observed planetary boundary layer (PBL) heights derived from radar wind profilers. Overall model performance is as good as or better than similar MM5 evaluation studies. The MM5 simulations with the ACM2 compare particularly well to PBL heights derived from radar wind profilers during the afternoon hours. The ACM2 is designed to simulate the vertical mixing of any modeled quantity realistically for both meteorological models and air quality models. The next step, to be described in a subsequent article, is to incorporate the ACM2 into the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for testing and evaluation.},

  abstract = {The Pleim--Xiu land surface model (PX LSM) has been improved by the addition of a second indirect data assimilation scheme. The first, which was described previously, is a technique in which soil moisture is nudged according to the biases in 2-m air temperature and relative humidity between the model- and observationbased analyses. The new technique involves nudging the deep soil temperature in the soil temperature force--restore (FR) model according to model bias in 2-m air temperature only during nighttime. While the FR technique is computationally efficient and very accurate for the special conditions for which it was derived, it is very dependent on the deep soil temperature that drives the restoration term of the surface soil temperature equation. Thus, adjustment of the deep soil temperature to optimize the 2-m air temperature during the night, when surface forcing is minimal, provides significant advantages over other methods of deep soil moisture initialization. Simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) using the PX LSM with and without the new deep soil temperature nudging scheme demonstrate substantial benefits of the new scheme for reducing error and bias of the 2-m air temperature. The effects of the new nudging scheme are most pronounced in the winter (January 2006) during which the model's cold bias is greatly reduced. Air temperature error and bias are also reduced in a summer simulation (August 2006) with the greatest benefits in less vegetated and more arid regions. Thus, the deep temperature nudging scheme complements the soil moisture nudging scheme because it is most effective for conditions in which the soil moisture scheme is least effective, that is, when evapotranspiration is not important (winter and arid climates).},

One of the main challenges in optimizing the design, operation, control, and grid integration of wind farms is the prediction of their performance, owing to the complex multiscale two-way interactions between wind farms and the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). From a fluid mechanical perspective, these interactions are complicated by the high Reynolds number of the ABL flow, its inherent unsteadiness due to the diurnal cycle and synoptic-forcing variability, the ubiquitous nature of thermal effects, and the heterogeneity of the terrain. Particularly important is the effect of ABL turbulence on wind-turbine wake flows and their superposition, as they are responsible for considerable turbine power losses and fatigue loads in wind farms. These flow interactions affect, in turn, the structure of the ABL and the turbulent fluxes of momentum and scalars. This review summarizes recent experimental, computational, and theoretical research efforts that have contributed to improving our understanding and ability to predict the interactions of ABL flow with wind turbines and wind farms.},

  abstract = {Stratocumulus clouds are the most common type of boundary layer cloud; their radiative effects strongly modulate climate. Large eddy simulations (LES) of stratocumulus clouds often struggle to maintain fidelity to observations because of the sharp gradients occurring at the entrainment interfacial layer at the cloud top. The challenge posed to LES by stratocumulus clouds is evident in the wide range of solutions found in the LES intercomparison based on the DYCOMS-II field campaign, where simulated liquid water paths for identical initial and boundary conditions varied by a factor of nearly 12. Here we revisit the DYCOMS-II RF01 case and show that the wide range of previous LES results can be realized in a single LES code by varying only the numerical treatment of the equations of motion and the nature of subgrid-scale (SGS) closures. The simulations that maintain the greatest fidelity to DYCOMS-II observations are identified. The results show that using weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) numerics for all resolved advective terms and no explicit SGS closure consistently produces the highest-fidelity simulations. This suggests that the numerical dissipation inherent in WENO schemes functions as a high-quality, implicit SGS closure for this stratocumulus case. Conversely, using oscillatory centered difference numerical schemes for momentum advection, WENO numerics for scalars, and explicitly modeled SGS fluxes consistently produces the lowest-fidelity simulations. We attribute this to the production of anomalously large SGS fluxes near the cloud tops through the interaction of numerical error in the momentum field with the scalar SGS model.},

Topics considered include the drag properties of rough surfaces as functions of the roughness geometry, the mean and turbulent velocity fields above the roughness sublayer, the properties of the flow close to and within the roughness canopy, and the nature of the organized motion in rough-wall boundary layers. Overall, there is strong support for the hypothesis of wall similarity: At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, rough-wall and smooth-wall boundary layers have the same turbulence structure above the roughness (or viscous) sublayer, scaling with height, boundary-layer thickness, and friction velocity.}

  abstract = {Cloud-top entrainment is a crucial process for the evolution of stratocumulus and is driven by interactions of radiation, microphysics, and turbulence on scales reaching down to less than one meter. Regardless of this fact, most large-eddy simulation studies still apply a horizontal resolution of tens of meters, not resolving these interactions sufficiently. Here, based on an extensive observational campaign, we define a weak-shear benchmark scenario for large-eddy simulation over Arctic ice and for the first time perform large-eddy simulation of mixed-phase stratocumulus with horizontal resolutions of 35, 10, and 3.5 m. Thereby, we investigate the processes contributing to cloud-top entrainment and their role for the evolution of stratocumulus with a particular focus on resolution sensitivity. First, we find that a horizontal grid spacing larger than 10 m insufficiently represents the effects of small-scale microphysical cooling and turbulent engulfment on cloud-top entrainment. Indeed, the small size of energycontaining eddies---a consequence of the intense stratification in the vicinity of the cloud-top region---violates the underlying assumptions of subgridscale models by buoyant suppression of eddies at the large-eddy simulation filter scale. Second, the decrease in cloud-top entrainment due to these insufficiently represented processes results in 15\% less cloud water after 6 h of simulation and a corresponding optical thinning of the cloud. Third, we show that the applied nonequilibrium microphysics cause microphysical heating beneath the cloud top, which partly counteracts the evaporative cooling.},

  abstract = {Precipitation nowcasting, the high-resolution forecasting of precipitation up to two hours ahead, supports the real-world socioeconomic needs of many sectors reliant on weather-dependent decision-making1,2. State-of-the-art operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events such as convective initiations3,4. Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints5,6. While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536\,km\,{\texttimes}\,1,280\,km and with lead times from 5--90\,min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89\% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle.},

  abstract = {We investigate the cumulative added value of assimilating temperature, moisture, and wind observations in the three-dimensional non-hydrostatic Fifth-Generation Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model MM5 and use these forecasts to analyze the relationship between surface forcing and planetary boundary-layer (PBL) depth. A data assimilation methodology focused on the surface and the PBL, previously tested in a one-dimensional version of MM5, is applied to 29 May, 6 June, and 7 June 2002 during the International H2O Project over the Southern Great Plains. Model-predicted PBL depth is evaluated against PBL depth diagnosed from data across 4,800 km of airborne lidar data (flight tracks 100--300 km long). The forecast with data assimilation verifies better against observations and is thus used to investigate the environmental conditions that govern PBL depth. The spatial structure in PBL depth is found to be most affected by spatial variations in surface buoyancy flux and capping inversion strength. The spatial scales of surface flux forcing reflected in the PBL depth are found through Fourier analysis and multiresolution decomposition. Correlations are {$<$}0.50 at scales of 64 km or less and increase at larger scales for 29 May and 6 June, but on 7 June low correlations are found at all scales, possibly due to greater within-PBL wind speeds, a stronger capping inversion on this day, and clouds. The results suggest a minimum scale, a function of wind speed, below which heterogeneity in surface buoyancy fluxes is not reflected directly in PBL depth.},

The resulting IBM method has been integrated in various flow solvers available in the CFD platform OpenFOAM. A rigorous validation has been performed considering different test cases of increasing complexity. The results have been compared with a large number of references available in the literature of experimental and numerical nature.

  abstract = {This study analyzes the effects of land surface heterogeneities at various horizontal scales on the transition from shallow to deep convection and on the cloud size distribution. An idealized case of midlatitude summertime convection is simulated by means of large-eddy simulations coupled to an interactive land surface. The transition is accelerated over heterogeneous surfaces. The simulation with an intermediate patch size of 12.8 km exhibits the fastest transition with a transition time two-thirds that over a homogeneous surface. A similar timing is observed for the precipitation onset whereas the total accumulated rainfall tends to increase with patch size. The cloud size distribution can be approximated by a power law with a scale break. The exponent of the power law is independent of the heterogeneity scale, implying a similar cloud cover between the simulations. In contrast, the scale break varies with patch size. The size of the largest clouds does not scale with the boundary layer height, although their maximum size scales with the patch size. Finally, the idea that larger clouds grow faster, known from homogeneous surface conditions, is not fully valid over heterogeneous surfaces. These various aspects can be understood from the complex interplay between the characteristics of the triggered mesoscale circulations and a cloud development acting in response to the diurnal cycle in surface heating. The results also call for adequate representation of such effects in convective parameterizations.},

For the conditions computed, although the stratification introduced definite wave-like characteristics into the flowfields, the non-linearity, as expressed for example by the spectral energy transfer, remained strong. However, the selective suppression of certain types of transfer was observed to occur.},

Results from theoretical analyses, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations are presented. The limiting form of the equations of motion appears to describe the laboratory experiments and numerical simulations rather well. There are similarities with the dynamics of two-dimensional flows, but three-dimensional effects are clearly important. A number of remaining open issues are discussed.},

It is found that, for all orientations of the mean scalar gradient, the sum of the pressure-scalar gradient and velocity gradient-scalar gradient terms in the turbulent scalar flux balance equation are approximately aligned with the scalar flux vector itself. In addition, the time derivative of the scalar flux is also approximately aligned with the flux vector for the developed fields (corresponding to roughly constant correlation coefficients). These alignments lead directly to a gradient transport model with a tensor turbulent diffusivity. The simulation results are used to fit a dimensionless model coefficient as a function of the turbulence Reynolds and P{\'e}clet numbers. The model is tested against two different passive-scalar fields in fully developed turbulent channel flow (also generated by direct numerical simulation) and is found to predict the scalar flux quite well throughout the entire channel.},

  abstract = {In this work, we study the characteristics of a stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer using large-eddy simulation (LES). In order to simulate the stable planetary boundary layer, we developed a modified version of the two-part subgrid-scale model of Sullivan et al. This improved version of the model is used to simulate a highly cooled yet fairly windy stable boundary layer with a surface heat flux of w{\texttheta} o = -0.05 m K s-1 and a geostrophic wind speed of Ug = 15 m s-1. Flow visualization and evaluation of the turbulence statistics from this case reveal the development of a continuously turbulent boundary layer with small-scale structures. The stability of the boundary layer coupled with the presence of a strong capping inversion results in the development of a dominant gravity wave at the top of the stable boundary layer that appears to be related to the most unstable wave predicted by the Taylor--Goldstein equation. As a result of the decay of turbulence aloft, a strong-low level jet forms above the boundary layer. The time dependent behaviour of the jet is compared with Blackadar's inertial oscillation analysis.},

In neutral conditions, wind and temperature profiles are the same as the standard log-law profile. Under unstable conditions, the differences are smaller than 1.5\%; conversely, under stable conditions, the differences reach up to - 5.2\%. The coefficients a and b are analyzed here to evaluate the limits of this proposed semi-empirical function and possible physical characteristics are discussed. Although we use the same theoretical assumptions and limitations of Monin--Obukhov similarity theory in the surface layer, the proposed function has the flexibility of adjusting the wind and temperature gradients for specific sites using the empirical coefficients a and b within the range 0--1, with stable and unstable conditions able to be described by a single general function.},

  abstract = {Since its inception in the 1940s, Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), which relates turbulent fluxes to mean vertical gradients in the lower atmosphere, has become ubiquitous for predicting surface fluxes of quantities transported by the flow in numerical weather, climate, and hydrological forecasting models. Despite its widespread use, MOST does not account for the effects of large coherent structures in the flow, which modulate the amplitude of turbulent fluctuations, and are responsible for a large fraction of the total transport. Herein, we demonstrate that the incorporation of the large-scale streamwise velocity ul(x,t)=G{$\delta\star$}u(x,t), where G{$\delta$} is a low-pass filtering kernel, into dimensional analysis leads to an additional dimensionless parameter {$\alpha$}(x,t), which captures the modulating influence of these structures on flux-gradient relationships. Atmospheric observations and large-eddy simulations are used to demonstrate that observed deviations from MOST can indeed be explained by this new parameter; coherent structures induce an alternating loading and unloading of the mean velocity gradient near the surface.},

  abstract = {Turbulence in the very stable nocturnal boundary layer is weak, patchy and intermittent. Near the surface isolated bursts of turbulent activity, characterised by abrupt changes in vertical velocity variance, have been shown to play an important role in determining the vertical transport of pollutants. However, there is little consensus as to the most appropriate methods for identifying or analysing the characteristics of intermittent turbulence that are of direct relevance to air quality studies. This paper presents an original technique, based on wavelet analysis, to objectively isolate intermittent turbulent `bursts' within vertical velocity time series. The technique permits the quantitative description of global intermittency and can be used to assess the duration and strength of turbulence within a time series. The technique is applied to a dataset from a summer field experiment in the Lower Fraser Valley, British Columbia, 1998. A very stable nocturnal boundary layer was observed in this region of complex terrain during anticyclonic synoptic conditions. During the 11 nights studied turbulent activity was characterised (within each 30-min time series) by three to four individual bursts persisting for less than 10 min in total. The implications of these results for air quality studies are discussed within the context of the vertical mixing of ozone (stored within the residual layer) to the surface. Results show that, despite the complexity of the processes determining nocturnal surface ozone concentration, the strength and duration of turbulent bursts can play an important role in determining local surface concentrations.},

The underlying concept is similar to that of a hot wire anemometer extended in space. The correlation coefficient between U measured by two colocated sonic anemometers and the AHFO were 0.91 during the day and 0.87 at night. The combination of classical passive and novel AHFO provides unprecedented dynamic observations of both air temperature and wind speed spanning 4 orders of magnitude in spatial scale (0.1--1000 m) while resolving individual turbulent motions, opening new opportunities for testing basic theories for near-surface geophysical flows.},

We show that Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) models that utilize modern, accelerated (e.g., by GPU or coprocessor), parallel hardware systems can now provide turbulence-resolving numerical weather forecasts over a region the size of the Netherlands at 100-m resolution.

These waves often form a series of roll clouds on their crests analogous to the ``morning glory,'' which is observed around the Gulf of Carpentaria in northeastern Australia. High-resolution visible satellite imagery from NASA's polar-orbiting Aqua and Terra satellites between 23 October 2004 and 29 February 2008 is used to determine how frequently these cloud lines occur ahead of cold fronts. A total of 14 cases are identified with the most cases occurring in summer and none occurring in winter. The authors hypothesize that the summer maximum is due to a combination of lower cloud amounts associated with summertime cold fronts, and a stronger maritime stable layer, which is produced as hot continental air, is advected offshore.             Three cloud line events are modeled using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University--National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU--NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5, version 3.6). In each case the low-level divergence field reveals convergence lines, which coincide with the cloud lines as identified on the satellite images. In two cases vertical cross sections of virtual potential temperature and horizontal and vertical velocity through the disturbances show a cold front advancing into a stratified environment leading to wave production at the leading edge of the cold air mass. Modeled maximal upward velocities range between 0.8 and 2.5 m s-1. Surface pressure jumps of about 1 hPa associated with the propagating waves occur in each case, which coincides with that predicted by simple bore theory. In two cases the front moves at supercritical speed (i.e., the frontal speed is larger than the speed of the fastest mode of small-amplitude long waves). In the third case the front does not propagate and the nonlinear waves produced become stationary as well.},

The model, which is a slight generalization of the cloud-topped, mixed-layer model of Lilly (1968), has as dependent variables the cloud-top height, cloud-base height, mixed-layer moist static energy and total water content, the turbulent fluxes of moist static energy and total water, the cloud-top jumps of moist static energy and total water, the cloud-top temperature, and the net radiative flux divergence at cloud top and in the mixed layer.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Under horizontally homogeneous steady-state conditions the governing equations reduce to a system of algebraic equations which is easily solved. This system has been solved for sea surface temperatures between 13 and 18{$^\circ$}C and large-scale divergences between 1{\texttimes}10\textsuperscript{-6} and 6{\texttimes}10\textsuperscript{-6} s\textsuperscript{-1}. These calculations have been performed for the case when all the radiative cooling is confined to the cloud-top jump condition and for the case when some of the cooling is allowed to extend into the mixed layer. The results show that the general pattern of mixed-layer response to sea surface temperature and large-scale divergence is not highly sensitive to the radiation partition. The results also show that the thermodynamic properties of the mixed layer and the surface fluxes of moist static energy and water vapor are sensitive to sea surface temperature but not to large-scale divergence. However, the mixed-layer depth is sensitive to large-scale divergence. Roughly speaking, the depth is inversely proportional to divergence so that halving the divergence approximately doubles the depth of the layer, which means that the cloud top seeks a certain subsidence (entrainment) rate. The turbulent fluxes of heat, water vapor and liquid water are discontinuous at cloud base. These discontinuities are interpreted in terms of convective parcel paths.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Tor Bergeron was a key member of the Bergen School of Meteorology that developed some of the most influential contributions to synoptic analysis in the twentieth century: airmass analysis, polar-front theory, and the Norwegian cyclone model. However, the eventual success of these so-called Bergen methods of synoptic analysis was not guaranteed. Concerns and criticisms of the methods---in part from the lack of referencing to prior studies, overly simplified conceptual models, and lack of real data in papers by J. Bjerknes and Solberg---were inhibiting worldwide adoption. Bergeron's research output in the 1920s was aimed at addressing these concerns. His doctoral thesis, written in German, was published as a journal article in Geofysiske Publikasjoner in 1928. Here, an accessible and annotated English translation is provided along with a succinct overview of this seminal study. Major interlaced themes of Bergeron's study were the first comprehensive description of the Bergen methods: a vigorous defense of cyclogenesis as primarily a lower-tropospheric process as opposed to an upper-tropospheric--lower-stratospheric one; a nuanced explanation of the assertion that meteorology constituted a distinct and special scientific discipline; and, very understandably, a thorough account of Bergeron's own contributions to the Bergen School. His contributions included identifying how deformation results in frontogenesis and frontolysis, classifying the influence of aerosols on visibility, and explaining the role of the ambient conditions in the onset of drizzle as opposed to rain showers---a distinction that led the formulation of the Wegener--Bergeron--Findeisen process.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations resolving meter and submeter scales in the cloud-top region of stratocumulus are used to investigate the interactions between a mean vertical wind shear and in-cloud turbulence driven by evaporative and radiative cooling. There are three major results. First, a critical velocity jump (Du)crit exists, above which shear significantly broadens the entrainment interfacial layer (EIL), enhances cloud-top cooling, and increases the mean entrainment velocity; shear effects are negligible when the velocity jump is below (Du)crit. Second, a depletion velocity jump (Du)dep exists, above which shear-enhanced mixing reduces cloud-top radiative cooling, thereby weakening the large convective motions; shear effects remain localized within the EIL when the velocity jump is below (Du)dep. The critical velocity jump and depletion velocity jump are provided as a function of in-cloud and free-tropospheric conditions, and one finds (Du)crit ' 124 m s21 and (Du)dep ' 3210 m s21 for typical subtropical conditions. Third, the individual contributions to the mean entrainment velocity from mixing, radiative cooling, and evaporative cooling strongly depend on the choice of the reference height where the entrainment velocity is calculated. This result implies that the individual contributions to the mean entrainment velocity should be estimated at a comparable height while deriving entrainment-rate parameterizations. A strong shear alters substantially the magnitude and the height where these individual contributions reach their maxima, which further demonstrates the importance of shear on the dynamics of stratocumulus clouds.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) under a wide range of stabilities are conducted to educe very-large-scale motions and then to study their dynamics and how they are influenced by buoyancy. Preliminary flow visualizations suggest that smaller-scale motions that resemble hairpins are embedded in much larger scale streamwise meandering rolls. Using simulations that represent more than 150 h of physical time, many snapshots in the x y-, yz- and x z-planes are then collected to perform snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition and further investigate the large structures. These analyses confirm that large streamwise rolls that share several features with the very-large-scale motions observed in laboratory studies arise as the dominant modes under most stabilities, but the effect of the surface kinematic buoyancy flux on the energy content of these dominant modes is very significant. The first two modes in the yz-plane in the neutral case contain up to 3 \% of the total turbulent kinetic energy; they also have a vertical tilt angle in the yz-plane of about 0 to 30{\textopenbullet} due to the turning effect associated with the Coriolis force. Unstable cases also feature streamwise rolls, but in the convective ABL they are strengthened by rising plumes in between them, with two to four rolls spanning the whole domain in the first few modes; the Coriolis effect is much weaker in the unstable ABL. These rolls are no longer the dominant modes under stable conditions where the first mode is observed to contain sheet-like motions with high turbulent kinetic energy. Using these proper orthogonal decomposition modes, we are also able to extract the vertical velocity fields corresponding to individual modes and then to correlate them with the horizontal velocity or temperature fields to obtain the momentum and heat flux carried by individual modes. Structurally, the fluxes are explained by the topology of their corresponding modes. However, the fraction of the fluxes produced by the modes is invariably smaller than the fraction of energy they contain, particularly under stable conditions where the first modes are found to perform weak counter-gradient fluxes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Direct numerical simulations of stably stratified Ekman layers are conducted to study the effect of increasing static stability on turbulence dynamics and modelling in wall-bounded flows at three moderate Reynolds numbers. The flow field is analysed by examining the mean profiles of wind speed, potential temperature and momentum flux, as well as streamwise velocity and temperature spectra. The maximum stabilizing buoyancy flux that a flow can sustain while remaining fully turbulent is found to depend on the Reynolds number. The flows with the highest Reynolds number display a relatively well-developed inertial range and logarithmic layer, and are found to bear similarities to much higher-Reynolds-number flows like the ones encountered in the atmospheric boundary layer. In particular, the near-wall mean profiles follow the Monin--Obukhov similarity theory. However, several flow features, such as the critical Richardson number and the stress--strain alignment, are found to maintain significant dependence on the Reynolds number. The budgets of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), vertical velocity variance, momentum and buoyancy fluxes, and temperature variance are analysed. The results indicate that the effect of stability on turbulence is first directly manifested in the vertical velocity variance budget, and results in damping of vertical motions. This then leads to a reduction in the downward transport of horizontal momentum components towards the surface, and consequently to a decrease in the shear production term in the TKE budget: changes in the vertical profile of TKE shear production with increasing Richardson number are significant and have a larger impact on TKE than direct buoyancy destruction. The reduction in vertical velocity variance also results in significant drops in the production terms in the momentum flux, buoyancy flux and temperature variance budgets. Various assumptions and parameters related to low-order turbulence closures are investigated. The results suggest that the vertical velocity variance is a more appropriate parameter than the full TKE on which to base eddy-diffusivity and viscosity models.},

New developments are made to the land-surface scheme to ensure the adequate representation of atmosphere--land-surface transfers on the large-eddy scale. These include, (1) a multi-layer canopy scheme; (2) a method for flux estimates consistent with the large-eddy subgrid closure; and (3) an appropriate soil-layer configuration. The model is then applied to a heterogeneous region with 60-m horizontal resolution and the results are compared with ground-based and airborne measurements. The simulated sensible and latent heat fluxes are found to agree well with the eddy-correlation measurements. Good agreement is also found in the modelled and observed net radiation, ground heat flux, soil temperature and moisture. Based on the model results, we study the patterns of the sensible and latent heat fluxes, how such patterns come into existence, and how large eddies propagate and destroy land-surface signals in the atmosphere. Near the surface, the flux and land-use patterns are found to be closely correlated. In the lower boundary layer, small eddies bearing land-surface signals organize and develop into larger eddies, which carry the signals to considerably higher levels. As a result, the instantaneous flux patterns appear to be unrelated to the land-use patterns, but on average, the correlation between them is significant and persistent up to about 650 m. For a given land-surface type, the scatter of the fluxes amounts to several hundred W m-2, due to (1) large-eddy randomness; (2) rapid large-eddy and surface feedback; and (3) local advection related to surface heterogeneity.},

The theory extends the classical inviscid inertialoscillation model of LLJs to include up- and downslope motion in the boundary layer within a stably stratified environment. The particular scenario considered is typical of LLJs over the Great Plains of the United States: southerly geostrophic wind over terrain that gently slopes down toward the east. First, an initial value problem for the coupled equations of motion and thermodynamic energy is solved for air parcels suddenly freed of a frictional constraint near sunset. The solution is an oscillation that takes, on the hodograph plane, the form of an ellipse having an eastward-oriented major axis and an eccentricity that increases with increasing stratification and slope angle. Next, the notion of a tilted residual layer (TRL) is introduced and used to relate initial (sunset) air parcel buoyancy to free-atmosphere stratification and thermal structure of the boundary layer. Application of the TRL-estimated initial buoyancy in the solution of the initial value problem leads to expressions for peak jet strength and the slope angle that maximizes the jet strength. Analytical results are in reasonable qualitative agreement with observational data.},

  abstract = {The Prandtl number dependence of unsteady laminar natural convection along an infinite vertical plate in a thermally stratified fluid is investigated. Flows are induced by an impulsive (step) change in plate temperature and by a suddenly imposed plate heat flux. Analytical solutions of the viscous equations of motion and thermodynamic energy are obtained for Prandtl numbers near unity by the method of Laplace transforms and a regular perturbation expansion. The zeroth-, first- and second-order terms in the expansion are obtained for an impulsive change in plate temperature, while the zeroth- and first-order terms are obtained for a sudden application of a plate heat flux. The developing boundary layers are thicker, more vigorous, and more sensitive to the Prandtl number at smaller Prandtl numbers ({$<$}1) than at larger Prandtl numbers ({$>$}1). The analytical results are confirmed and extended with results from numerical simulations for Prandtl numbers strongly deviating from unity.},

  abstract = {A theory is presented for the Great Plains low-level jet in which the jet emerges in the sloping atmospheric boundary layer as the nocturnal phase of an oscillation arising from diurnal variations in turbulent diffusivity (Blackadar mechanism) and surface buoyancy (Holton mechanism). The governing equations are the equations of motion, mass conservation, and thermal energy for a stably stratified fluid in the Boussinesq approximation. Attention is restricted to remote (far above slope) geostrophic winds that blow along the terrain isoheights (southerly for the Great Plains). Diurnally periodic solutions are obtained analytically with diffusivities that vary as piecewise constant functions of time and slope buoyancies that vary as piecewise linear functions of time. The solution is controlled by 11 parameters: slope angle, Coriolis parameter, freeatmosphere Brunt--V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency, free-atmosphere geostrophic wind, radiative damping parameter, day and night diffusivities, maximum and minimum surface buoyancies, and times of maximum surface buoyancy and sunset. The Holton mechanism, by itself, results in relatively weak wind maxima but produces strong jets when paired with the Blackadar mechanism. Jets with both Blackadar and Holton mechanisms operating are shown to be broadly consistent with observations and climatological analyses. Jets strengthen with increasing geostrophic wind, maximum surface buoyancy, and day-to-night ratio of the diffusivities and weaken with increasing Brunt--V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and magnitude of minimum slope buoyancy (greater nighttime cooling). Peak winds are maximized for slope angles characteristic of the Great Plains.},

  abstract = {Katabatic flows along a planar slope in a viscous stably-stratified fluid are investigated analytically and numerically, with an emphasis on flow features arising from the action of the Coriolis force. Two idealized flow types are considered: turbulent flow along a uniformly cooled slope, and two-dimensional laminar flow induced by a cold strip of finite width running down the slope. In the case of turbulent flow along a uniformly cooled slope, the downslope velocity exhibits a boundary-layer structure, but the cross-slope velocity and buoyancy fields spread inexorably upward. This behaviour is qualitatively similar to that found in laminar flows along a uniformly cooled slope. In contrast, in the two-dimensional strip flow, a steady state is reached, in which the cross-slope wind and buoyancy fields vanish far above the slope, but the downslope and slope-normal velocity fields do not vanish. These latter two flow components comprise two purely horizontal along-isentrope counter-flowing currents: an upslope current entering the top of the boundary layer on one side of the strip, and a downslope current flowing out of the boundary layer into the environment on the other side of the strip. The slope-normal vorticity associated with these currents originates in the stretching of planetary vorticity in a broad zone of convergent flow over the cold strip.

A large computational box and a long averaging time were employed to capture the turbulence structure and the inertial oscillation. A unique turbulence structure was found in the region where the mean velocity reached its maximum, whereas the well-known streak structure appeared in the vicinity of the wall. Detailed characteristics of the turbulence structures have been discussed using the obtained instantaneous flow field and statistics such as the premultiplied energy spectra and the two-point correlations. The effect of turbulence structure on the turbulence statistics is also examined. At the same time, inertial oscillation is detected in the upper region. Its existing area and comparison with the analytical solution are discussed.},

Boundary and near boundary schemes of the same order as the interior are also developed using polynomial interpolation and for a general compact scheme on a non-uniform grid it is shown that polynomial interpolation is more efficient than the conventional method of undetermined coefficients for finding coefficients of the scheme. The high-order non-uniform schemes along with boundary closure of up to 14th order thus obtained are shown to be stable on a non-uniform grid with appropriate stretching so that more grid points are clustered near the boundary. The stability and resolution properties of the high-order non-uniform grid schemes are studied and the results of three numerical tests on stability and accuracy properties are also presented.},

  abstract = {With the Arctic rapidly changing, the needs to observe, understand, and model the changes are essential. To support these needs, an annual cycle of observations of atmospheric properties, processes, and interactions were made while drifting with the sea ice across the central Arctic during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition from October 2019 to September 2020. An international team designed and implemented the comprehensive program to document and characterize all aspects of the Arctic atmospheric system in unprecedented detail, using a variety of approaches, and across multiple scales. These measurements were coordinated with other observational teams to explore cross-cutting and coupled interactions with the Arctic Ocean, sea ice, and ecosystem through a variety of physical and biogeochemical processes. This overview outlines the breadth and complexity of the atmospheric research program, which was organized into 4 subgroups: atmospheric state, clouds and precipitation, gases and aerosols, and energy budgets. Atmospheric variability over the annual cycle revealed important influences from a persistent large-scale winter circulation pattern, leading to some storms with pressure and winds that were outside the interquartile range of past conditions suggested by long-term reanalysis. Similarly, the MOSAiC location was warmer and wetter in summer than the reanalysis climatology, in part due to its close proximity to the sea ice edge. The comprehensiveness of the observational program for characterizing and analyzing atmospheric phenomena is demonstrated via a winter case study examining air mass transitions and a summer case study examining vertical atmospheric evolution. Overall, the MOSAiC atmospheric program successfully met its objectives and was the most comprehensive atmospheric measurement program to date conducted over the Arctic sea ice. The obtained data will support a broad range of coupled-system scientific research and provide an important foundation for advancing multiscale modeling capabilities in the Arctic.},

  abstract = {A new high-resolution code for the direct simulation of incompressible boundary layers over a flat plate is described. It can accommodate a wide range of pressure gradients, and general time-dependent boundary conditions such as incoming wakes or wall forcing. The consistency orders of the advective and pressure-correction steps are different, but it is shown that the overall resolution is controlled by the higher-order advection step. The formulation of boundary conditions to ensure global mass conservation in the presence of arbitrary forcing is carefully analyzed. Two validation boundary layers with and without a strong adverse pressure gradient are presented, with maximum Reynolds numbers Reh \% 2000. They agree well with the available experiments. Turbulent inflow conditions for the zero-pressure case are implemented by a recycling method, and it is shown that at least the initial 300 momentum thicknesses have to be discarded before the effect of the artificial inflow is forgotten. It is argued that this is not a defect of the method used to generate the inflow, but a property of the boundary layer.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Most activities of humankind take place in the transition zone between four compartments of the terrestrial system: the unconfined aquifer, including the unsaturated zone; surface water; vegetation; and atmosphere. The mass, momentum, and heat energy fluxes between these compartments drive their mutual state evolution. Improved understanding of the processes that drive these fluxes is important for climate projections, weather prediction, flood forecasting, water and soil resources management, agriculture, and water quality control. The different transport mechanisms and flow rates within the compartments result in complex patterns on different temporal and spatial scales that make predictions of the terrestrial system challenging for scientists and policy makers. The Transregional Collaborative Research Centre 32 (TR32) was formed in 2007 to integrate monitoring with modeling and data assimilation in order to develop a holistic view of the terrestrial system. TR32 is a long-term research program funded by the German national science foundation Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), in order to focus and integrate research activities of several universities on an emerging scientific topic of high societal relevance. Aiming to bridge the gap between microscale soil pores and catchment-scale atmospheric variables, TR32 unites research groups from the German universities of Aachen, Bonn, and Cologne, and from the environmental and geoscience departments of Forschungszentrum J{\"u}lich GmbH. Here, we report about recent achievements in monitoring and modeling of the terrestrial system, including the development of new observation techniques for the subsurface, the establishment of cross-scale, multicompartment modeling platforms from the pore to the catchment scale, and their use to investigate the propagation of patterns in the state and structure of the subsurface to the atmospheric boundary layer.},

The problems involved in using synoptic observations to derive methods of predicting clouds are discussed. Only limited success was obtained in relating observed cloud amounts to relative humidity and atmospheric temperature structure. The restrictions imposed on the cloud scheme by the model's resolution and by its inability to produce a perfect simulation are considered. In the light of these difficulties a simple approach was adopted based on the assumption that condensation on the smallest scales is part of a larger-scale condensation regime related to the synoptic scale situation. The scheme has been designed to reproduce the main features of a cloud field by relating the large-scale meteorological features associated with a cloud distribution to model variables. Low, medium and high cloud amounts are determined from a quadratic relationship with relative humidity. Low cloud has also been related to the temperature lapse rate in an attempt to model the persistent areas of sub-tropical stratocumulus occurring under inversions. A relative humidity relationship is inappropriate for convective cloud which has, therefore, been related to the convective mass flux calculated in the convection scheme of the model. The scheme has been reasonably successful in predicting the cloudiness associated with the ITCZ and the NE. and SE. trades. The cloud fields showed a good degree of coherence from day to day and there were no signs of unrealistic feedbacks between radiation, cloud and dynamics.},

  abstract = {Turbulent characteristics of a 50 to 100 m deep convective internal boundary layer (I.B.L.) have been studied. The data were gathered at a flat coastal site (Ngsudden on the island of Gotland, Sweden) during three consecutive days in May 1980 which were characterized by a steady, very stable stratified marine approach flow. The site is situated on a flat area ca. 1500 m from the shoreline. Only daytime runs have been analysed in the present paper. The sensible heat flux at the ground was typically 200 W mm2 and was found to decrease more or less linearly with height throughout the I.B.L., being slightly negative at greater heights. The momentum flux was also found to decrease with height, but nevertheless shear production of turbulent kinetic energy was found to be large throughout the entire I.B.L.},

The boundary layer was characterized by stable stratification and the presence of a pronounced low level jet at very low height, 30-150 m, above the surface of the sea, The atmospheric surface layer was apparently extremely shallow; thus the non-dimensionalwind gradients and temperature gradients derived from measurements at 8 m do not show adherence to Monin-Obukhov similarity, in sharp contrast to findings from the same site at similar stability conditions but with no low level jet. Instead these quantities are shown to be governed by scales characteristic of stable shear flow away from the surface. The height to the jet centre appears to be an important quantity. Thus, for the cases with the lowest jet height values (30-50 m), some turbulent characteristics of the flow (non-dimensional velocity standard deviations and the correlation between the longitudinaland vertical velocity) have values similar to those found for the zero pressure-gradient laboratory boundary layer over a flat plate (the so called 'canonical' boundary layer) rather than the typical values found in atmospheric boundary-layerflow. It was inferred that the large scale fluctuations known as 'inactive' turbulence, as well as gravity waves, were suppressed in this case.},

The presented schemes are of increasing sophistication: the first model combines the soil model with heat and moisture budget equations for the ground surface and uses an explicit numerical scheme to compute the surface fluxes; the second model uses a more energy-conservative implicit solution for the latent and sensible surface fluxes and heat and moisture soil fluxes; the third model further incorporates a simple parameterization of the evapotranspiration process.},

  abstract = {The formation of cold air drainage flows in a shallow gully is studied during CASES-99 (Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study). Fast and slow response wind and temperature measurements were obtained on an instrumented 10-m tower located in the gully and from a network of thermistors and two-dimensional sonic anemometers, situated across the gully. Gully flow formed on clear nights even with significant synoptic flow. Large variations in surface temperature developed within an hour after sunset and in situ cooling was the dominant factor in wind sheltered locations. The depth of the drainage flow and the height of the down-gully wind speed maximum were found to be largest when the external wind speed above the gully flow is less than 2 m s-1. The shallow drainage current is restricted to a depth of a few metres, and is deepest when the stratification is stronger and the external flow is weaker. During the night the drainage flow breaks down, sometimes on several occasions, due to intermittent turbulence and downward fluxes of heat and momentum. The near surface temperature may increase by 6 {\textopenbullet}C in less than 30 min due to the vertical convergence of downward heat flux. The mixing events are related to acceleration of the flow above the gully flow and decreased Richardson number. These warming events also lead to warming of the near surface soil and reduction of the upward soil heat flux. To examine the relative importance of different physical mechanisms that could contribute to the rapid warming, and to characterize the turbulence generated during the intermittent turbulent periods, the sensible heat budget is analyzed and the behaviour of different turbulent parameters is discussed.},

However, the increasing complexity of hydrological models means that a large number of parameters need to be estimated. To better understand how these complex models work, efficient SA methods should be applied before the application of hydrological modeling. This study provides a comprehensive review of global SA methods in the field of hydrological modeling. The common definitions of SA and the typical categories of SA methods are described. A wide variety of global SA methods have been introduced to provide a more efficient evaluation framework for hydrological modeling. We review, analyze, and categorize research into global SA methods and their applications, with an emphasis on the research accomplished in the hydrological modeling field. The advantages and disadvantages are also discussed and summarized. An application framework and the typical practical steps involved in SA for hydrological modeling are outlined. Further discussions cover several important and often overlooked topics, including the relationship between parameter identification, uncertainty analysis, and optimization in hydrological modeling, how to deal with correlated parameters, and time-varying SA. Finally, some conclusions and guidance recommendations on SA in hydrological modeling are provided, as well as a list of important future research directions that may facilitate more robust analyses when assessing hydrological modeling performance.},

The gradient-based and flux-based similarity functions are assessed in terms of the Richardson number Ri and the stability parameter z/ {$\ast$}, z being height and {$\ast$} the local Obukhov length. The resulting functions are expressed in an analytical form, which is essentially unaffected by self-correlation, when thermal stratification is strong. Turbulence within the stably stratified boundary layer is classified into four regimes: ``nearly-neutral'' (0 {$<$} z/ {$\ast$} {$<$} 0.02), ``weakly-stable'' (0.02 {$<$} z/ {$\ast$} {$<$} 0.6), ``very-stable'' (0.6 {$<$} z/ {$\ast$} {$<$} 50), and ``extremely-stable'' (z/ {$\ast$} {$>$} 50). The flux-based similarity functions for gradients are constant in ``nearly-neutral'' conditions. In the ``very-stable'' regime, the dimensionless gradients are exponential, and proportional to (z/ {$\ast$})3/5. The existence of scaling laws in ``extremely-stable'' conditions is doubtful. The Prandtl number Pr decreases from 0.9 in nearly-neutral conditions and to about 0.7 in the very-stable regime. The necessary condition for the presence of steady-state turbulence is Ri {$<$} 0.7.},

  abstract = {The behavior of sensible heat flux H with stability parameter {$\zeta$} in the stable atmospheric surface layer is analyzed within the framework of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST). Using MOST equations, H is expressed as a function of {$\zeta$} and wind shear {$\partial$}U/{$\partial$}z. A systematic mathematical analysis is carried out to analyze the behavior of H with {$\zeta$} utilizing the linear as well as various nonlinear empirical functional forms of the similarity functions. In case of linear form, for a given value of H, two different values of {$\zeta$} along with the ``downward heat flux maximum'' with a unique critical point are found to occur. However, for the other selected empirical similarity functions, more than two values of {$\zeta$} having the same magnitude of H may occur suggesting the existence of multiple critical points. Further, the observational variation of H with {$\zeta$} is analyzed using data from three different sites. Data suggest the existence of two different stability regimes for the same magnitude of heat flux. However, the data do not support the existence of multiple values of {$\zeta$} for the same magnitude of H, as predicted by MOST with the other selected empirical forms of similarity functions. This suggests that the phenomenon of existence of downward heat flux maximum, as predicted by MOST equations, depends on the functional form of the similarity functions, and it appears to break down for some selected empirical forms of similarity functions under very stable conditions.},

Many physical processes come into play in the stable boundary layer (SBL), i.e., turbulence, radiation, land surface coupling and heterogeneity, orographic turbulent and gravity wave drag (GWD). The development of robust stable boundary-layer parameterizations for weather and climate models is difficult because of the multiplicity of processes and their complex interactions. As a result, these models suffer from biases in key variables, such as the 2-m temperature, boundary-layer depth and wind speed. This short paper briefly summarizes the state-of-the-art of SBL research, and highlights physical processes that received only limited attention so far, in particular orographically-induced GWD, longwave radiation divergence, and the land-atmosphere coupling over a snow-covered surface. Finally, a conceptual framework with relevant processes and particularly their interactions is proposed.},

There are substantial contributions from short-term 2 -- 5 year variations, which have clearly marked teleconnections. Decadal trends are also apparent in the historical record of the NAO and may be due to either stochastic or deterministic processes. Evidence is presented that suggests the NAO exhibits `long-range' dependence having winter values residually correlated over many years. Several simple stochastic models have been used to fit the NAO SLP (sea-level pressure) wintertime index over the period 1864 -- 1998, and their performance at predicting the following year has been assessed. Long-range fractionally integrated noise provides a better fit than does either stationary red noise or a non-stationary random walk. Copyright {\copyright} 2000 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Emphasis is placed on developing basic concepts, starting from general elementary considerations, and proceeding to the special and complex. In so doing we develop several central themes, such as the role of the boundary-layer depth, the differing characteristics of shear versus buoyancy and the models they most naturally engender. Two complications to these paradigms are considered, as examples of the complexity of real boundary layers. The first being the baroclinic boundary layer as a modification of the shear boundary layer, the second being the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer as an exotic form of the convective boundary layer.

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of a smoke cloud are examined with respect to their sensitivity to small scales as manifest in either the grid spacing or the subgrid-scale (SGS) model. Calculations based on a Smagorinsky SGS model are found to be more sensitive to the effective resolution of the simulation than are calculations based on the prognostic turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) SGS model. The difference between calculations based on the two SGS models is attributed to the advective transport, diffusive transport, and/or time-rate-of-change terms in the TKE equation. These terms are found to be leading order in the entrainment zone and allow the SGS TKE to behave in a way that tends to compensate for changes that result in larger or smaller resolved scale entrainment fluxes. This compensating behavior of the SGS TKE model is attributed to the fact that changes that reduce the resolved entrainment flux (viz., values of the eddy viscosity in the upper part of the PBL) simultaneously tend to increase the buoyant production of SGS TKE in the radiatively destabilized portion of the smoke cloud. Increased production of SGS TKE in this region then leads to increased amounts of transported, or fossil, SGS TKE in the entrainment zone itself, which in turn leads to compensating increases in the SGS entrainment fluxes. In the Smagorinsky model, the absence of a direct connection between SGS TKE in the entrainment and radiatively destabilized zones prevents this compensating mechanism from being active, and thus leads to calculations whose entrainment rate sensitivities as a whole reflect the sensitivities of the resolvedscale fluxes to values of upper PBL eddy viscosities.},

  abstract = {The logarithmic law for the mean velocity in turbulent boundary layers has long provided a valuable and robust reference for comparison with theories, models and large-eddy simulations (LES) of wall-bounded turbulence. More recently, analysis of high-Reynolds-number experimental boundary-layer data has shown that also the variance and higher-order moments of the streamwise velocity fluctuations u + display logarithmic laws. Such experimental observations motivate the question whether LES can accurately reproduce the variance and the higher-order moments, in particular their logarithmic dependency on distance to the wall. In this study we perform LES of very high-Reynolds-number wall-modelled channel flow and focus on profiles of variance and higher-order moments of the streamwise velocity fluctuations. In agreement with the experimental data, we observe an approximately logarithmic law for the variance in the LES, with a `Townsend--Perry' constant of A1 {$\approx$} 1.25. The LES also yields approximate logarithmic laws for the higher-order moments of the streamwise velocity. Good agreement is found between Ap, the generalized `Townsend--Perry' constants for moments of order 2p, from experiments and simulations. Both are indicative of sub-Gaussian behaviour of the streamwise velocity fluctuations. The near-wall behaviour of the variance, the ranges of validity of the logarithmic law and in particular possible dependencies on characteristic length scales such as the roughness length z0, the LES grid scale ∆, and subgrid scale mixing length Cs∆ are examined. We also present LES results on moments of spanwise and wall-normal fluctuations of velocity.},

The initial data and forcings for this case placed it in an interesting part of parameter space, near the boundary where cloud-top mixing is thought to render the cloud layer unstable on the one hand, or tending toward a decoupled structure on the other hand. The basis of this evaluation consists of sixteen 4-h simulations from 10 modeling centers over grids whose vertical spacing was 5 m at the cloud-top interface and whose horizontal spacing was 35 m. Extensive sensitivity studies of both the configuration of the case and the numerical setup also enhanced the analysis. Overall it was found that (i) if efforts are made to reduce spurious mixing at cloud top, either by refining the vertical grid or limiting the effects of the subgrid model in this region, then the observed turbulent and thermodynamic structure of the layer can be reproduced with some fidelity; (ii) the base, or native configuration of most simulations greatly overestimated mixing at cloud top, tending toward a decoupled layer in which cloud liquid water path and turbulent intensities were grossly underestimated; (iii) the sensitivity of the simulations to the representation of mixing at cloud top is, to a certain extent, amplified by particulars of this case. Overall the results suggest that the use of LESs to map out the behavior of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer in this interesting region of parameter space requires a more compelling representation of processes at cloud top. In the absence of significant leaps in the understanding of subgrid-scale (SGS) physics, such a representation can only be achieved by a significant refinement in resolution---a refinement that, while conceivable given existing resources, is probably still beyond the reach of most centers.},

  abstract = {Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) stands at the center of understanding of atmospheric surface-layer turbulence. Based on the hypothesis that a single length scale determined by surface fluxes governs the turbulent exchange of momentum, mass, and energy between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, MOST has been widely used in parametrizations of turbulent processes in virtually all numerical models of atmospheric flows. However, its inherent limitations to flat and horizontally homogeneous terrain, the non-scaling of horizontal velocity variances, and stable turbulence have plagued the theory since its inception. Thus, the limitations of MOST, and its use beyond its intended range of validity contribute to large uncertainty in weather, climate, and air-pollution models, particularly in polar regions and over complex terrain. Here we present a first generalized extension of MOST encompassing a wide range of realistic surface and flow conditions. The novel theory incorporates information on the directionality of turbulence exchange (anisotropy of the Reynolds stress tensor) as a key missing variable. The constants in the standard empirical MOST relations are shown to be functions of anisotropy, thus allowing a seamless transition between traditional MOST and its novel generalization. The new scaling relations, based on measurements from 13 well-known datasets ranging from flat to highly complex mountainous terrain, show substantial improvements to scaling under all stratifications. The results also highlight the role of anisotropy in explaining general characteristics of complex terrain and stable turbulence, adding to the mounting evidence that anisotropy fully encodes the information on the complexity of the boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) of a stable atmospheric boundary layer is performed using recently developed dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) models. These models not only calculate the Smagorinsky coefficient and SGS Prandtl number dynamically based on the smallest resolved motions in the flow, they also allow for scale dependence of those coefficients. This dynamic calculation requires statistical averaging for numerical stability. Here, we evaluate three commonly used averaging schemes in stable atmospheric boundary-layer simulations: averaging over horizontal planes, over adjacent grid points, and following fluid particle trajectories. Particular attention is focused on assessing the effect of the different averaging methods on resolved flow statistics and SGS model coefficients. Our results indicate that averaging schemes that allow the coefficients to fluctuate locally give results that are in better agreement with boundary-layer similarity theory and previous LES studies. Even among models that are local, the averaging method is found to affect model coefficient probability density function distributions and turbulent spectra of the resolved velocity and temperature fields. Overall, averaging along fluid pathlines is found to produce the best combination of self consistent model coefficients, first- and second-order flow statistics and insensitivity to grid resolution.},

This review examines development of the technique as a tool for ABL research, integration with state-of-the-art scientific computing resources, and some key application areas. Analysis of the published literature indicates that LES research across a broad range of applications accelerated starting around 1990. From that point in time, robust research using LES developed in several different application areas and based on a review of the papers published in this journal, we identify seven major areas of intensive ABL--LES research: convective boundary layers, stable boundary layers, transitional boundary layers, plant canopy flows, urban meteorology and dispersion, surface heterogeneity, and the testing and development of subgrid-scale (SGS) models. We begin with a general overview of LES and then proceed to examine the SGS models developed for use in ABL--LES. After this overview of the technique itself, we review the specific model developments tailored to the identified application areas and the scientific advancements realized using the LES technique in each area. We conclude by examining the computational trends in published ABL--LES research and identify some resource underutilization. Future directions and research needs are identified from a synthesis of the reviewed literature.},

Simulations are performed of a continuously turbulent SBL with surface heterogeneity added in the form of streamwise transitions in surface temperature. Temperature differences between patches of 6 and 3 K are explored with patch length scales ranging from one-half to twice the equivalent homogeneous boundary layer height. The surface temperature heterogeneity has important effects on the mean wind speed and potential temperature profiles as well as on the surface heat flux distribution. Increasing the difference between the patch temperatures results in decreased magnitude of the average surface heat flux, with a corresponding increase in the mean potential temperature in the boundary layer. The simulation results are also used to test existing models for average surface fluxes over heterogeneous terrain. The tested models fail to fully represent the average turbulent heat flux, with models that break the domain into homogeneous subareas grossly underestimating the heat flux magnitude over patches with relatively colder surface temperatures. Motivated by these results, a new parameterization based on local similarity theory is proposed. The new formulation is found to correct the bias over the cold patches, resulting in improved average surface heat flux calculations.},

The three stratification states are defined as unstable: Ri {$<$} -0.012, near-neutral: -0.012 {$<$} Ri {$<$} +0.001, and stable: Ri {$>$} +0.001. These boundaries are identified by the characteristic boundary layer coherent structures that form in these regimes and modulate the surface roughness imaged by the radar. An automated machine learning algorithm identifies the coherent structures impressed on the images. Data from 2016 to 2019 are used to examine spatial and temporal variation in these state estimates in terms of expected wind and thermal forcing.

  abstract = {The quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE) theory is an analytical spectral theory of turbulence based upon successive elimination of small scales of motion and calculating ensuing corrections to the viscosity and diffusivity. The main results of the theory are analytical expressions for eddy viscosity, eddy diffusivity, and kinetic energy and temperature spectra. Partial scale elimination yields a subgrid-scale representation for large-eddy simulations, whereas the elimination of all fluctuating scales is analogous to the Reynolds averaging. The scale-dependent analysis enables one to put processes on different scales at the spotlight and elucidate their contributions to eddy viscosities and eddy diffusivities. In addition, the method traces the modification of the flow with increasing stratification and recovers growing anisotropy and the effect of the internal waves. The QNSE-based Reynolds-averaged models present a viable alternative to conventional Reynolds stress models. A QNSE model of this kind was tested in the numerical weather prediction system HIRLAM instead of the existing reference Reynolds stress model. The performance of the QNSE model was superior in all simulations where stable stratification was noticeable.},

This shortcoming of LES has been attributed to poor grid resolution and inadequate sub-grid-scale (SGS) modeling. We study this deficiency in PBL LES solutions calculated over a range of shear and buoyancy forcing conditions. The discrepancy from similarity forms becomes larger with increasing shear and smaller buoyancy forcing, and persists even with substantial horizontal grid refinement. With strong buoyancy forcing, however, the error is negligible.},

Continuous weakly stratified turbulence is maintained for this range of cooling, and the SBL splits into two regions depending on the location of the lowlevel jet (LLJ) and Cr. Above the LLJ, turbulence is very weak and the gradient Richardson number is nearly constant: Ri ; 0:25. Below the LLJ, small scales are dynamically important as the shear and buoyancy frequencies vary with mesh resolution. The heights of the SBL and Ri noticeably decrease as the mesh is varied from 2003 to 10243. Vertical profiles of the Ozmidov scale Lo show its rapid decrease with increasing Cr, with Lo , 2 m over a large fraction of the SBL for high cooling. Flow visualization identifies ubiquitous warm--cool temperature fronts populating the SBL. The fronts span a large vertical extent, tilt forward more so as the surface cooling increases, and propagate coherently. In a height--time reference frame, an instantaneous vertical profile of temperature appears intermittent, exhibiting a staircase pattern with increasing distance from the surface. Observations from CASES-99 also display these features. Conditional sampling based on linear stochastic estimation is used to identify coherent structures. Vortical structures are found upstream and downstream of a temperature front, similar to those in neutrally stratified boundary layers, and their dynamics are central to the front formation.},

The analysis suggests that strong turbulent mixing is dominated by relatively large coherent eddies that are not related to local vertical gradients as assumed in MOST. The HOckey-Stick Transition (HOST) hypothesis is developed to explain the generation of observed large coherent eddies over a finite depth and the contribution of these eddies to vertical variations of turbulence intensity and atmospheric stratification throughout the diurnal cycle. The HOST hypothesis emphasizes the connection between dominant turbulent eddies and turbulence generation scales, and the coupling between the turbulence kinetic energy and the turbulence potential energy within the turbulence generation layer in determining turbulence intensity. For turbulence generation directly influenced by the surface, the HOST hypothesis recognizes the role of the surface both in the vertical variation of momentum and heat fluxes and its boundary effect on the size of the dominant turbulence eddies.},

We discuss important differences between turbulent mixing by the most energetic non-local, large, coherent turbulence eddies and local turbulent mixing as traditionally represented by K-theory (analog to molecular diffusion), especially in consideration of developing surface-layer stratification. The study indicates that the neutral state in a horizontally homogeneous surface layer described in the Monin--Obukhov bulk formula represents a special neutrality regardless of wind speed, for example, the surface layer with no surface heating/cooling. Under this situation, the Monin--Obukhov bulk formula agrees well with observations for heights to at least 30 m. As the surface layer is stratified, stably or unstably, the neutral state is achieved by mechanically generated turbulent mixing through the most energetic non-local coherent eddies. The observed neutral relationship between u{$\ast$} (the square root of the momentum flux magnitude) and wind speed V at any height is different from that described by the Monin--Obukhov formula except within several metres of the surface. The deviation of the Monin--Obukhov neutral u{$\ast-$}V linear relation from the observed one increases with height and contributes to the deteriorating performance of the bulk formula with increasing height, which cannot be compensated by stability functions. Based on these analyses, estimation of drag coefficients is discussed as well.},

  abstract = {An investigation of nocturnal intermittent turbulence during the Cooperative Atmosphere--Surface Exchange Study in 1999 (CASES-99) revealed three turbulence regimes at each observation height: 1) regime 1, a weak turbulence regime when the wind speed is less than a threshold value; 2) regime 2, a strong turbulence regime when the wind speed exceeds the threshold value; and 3) regime 3, a moderate turbulence regime when top-down turbulence sporadically bursts into the otherwise weak turbulence regime. For regime 1, the strength of small turbulence eddies is correlated with local shear and weakly related to local stratification. For regime 2, the turbulence strength increases systematically with wind speed as a result of turbulence generation by the bulk shear, which scales with the observation height. The threshold wind speed marks the transition above which the boundary layer approaches near-neutral conditions, where the turbulent mixing substantially reduces the stratification and temperature fluctuations. The preference of the turbulence regimes during CASES-99 is closely related to the existence and the strength of low-level jets. Because of the different roles of the bulk and local shear with regard to turbulence generation under different wind conditions, the relationship between turbulence strength and the local gradient Richardson number varies for the different turbulence regimes. Turbulence intermittency at any observation height was categorized in three ways: turbulence magnitude oscillations between regimes 1 and 2 as wind speed varies back and forth across its threshold value, episodic turbulence enhancements within regime 1 as a result of local instability, and downbursts of turbulence in regime 3.},

  abstract = {Flow in a stably stratified environment is characterized by anisotropic and intermittent turbulence and wavelike motions of varying amplitudes and periods. Understanding turbulence intermittency and wave-turbulence interactions in a stably stratified flow remains a challenging issue in geosciences including planetary atmospheres and oceans. The stable atmospheric boundary layer (SABL) commonly occurs when the ground surface is cooled by longwave radiation emission such as at night over land surfaces, or even daytime over snow and ice surfaces, and when warm air is advected over cold surfaces. Intermittent turbulence intensification in the SABL impacts human activities and weather variability, yet it cannot be generated in state-of-the-art numerical forecast models. This failure is mainly due to a lack of understanding of the physical mechanisms for seemingly random turbulence generation in a stably stratified flow, in which wave-turbulence interaction is a potential mechanism for turbulence intermittency. A workshop on wave-turbulence interactions in the SABL addressed the current understanding and challenges of wave-turbulence interactions and the role of wavelike motions in contributing to anisotropic and intermittent turbulence from the perspectives of theory, observations, and numerical parameterization. There have been a number of reviews on waves, and a few on turbulence in stably stratified flows, but not much on wave-turbulence interactions. This review focuses on the nocturnal SABL; however, the discussions here on intermittent turbulence and wave-turbulence interactions in stably stratified flows underscore important issues in stably stratified geophysical dynamics in general.},

  abstract = {The turning of wind with height and the related cross-isobaric (ageostrophic) flow in the thermally stable stratified boundary layer is analysed from a variety of model results acquired in the first Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS1). From the governing equations in this particular simple case it becomes clear that the cross-isobaric flow is solely determined by the surface turbulent stress in the direction of the geostrophic wind for the quasi-steady state conditions under consideration. Most models indeed seem to approach this relationship but for very different absolute values. Because turbulence closures used in operational models typically tend to give too deep a boundary layer, the integrated total cross-isobaric mass flux is up to three times that given by research numerical models and large-eddy simulation. In addition, the angle between the surface and the geostrophic wind is typically too low, which has important implications for the representation of the larger-scale flow. It appears that some models provide inconsistent results for the surface angle and the momentum flux profile, and when the results from these models are removed from the analysis, the remaining ten models do show a unique relationship between the boundary-layer depth and the surface angle, consistent with the theory given. The present results also imply that it is beneficial to locate the first model level rather close to the surface for a proper representation of the turning of wind with height in the stable boundary layer.},

  abstract = {We present the main results from the second model intercomparison within the GEWEX (Global Energy and Water cycle EXperiment) Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS). The target is to examine the diurnal cycle over land in today's numerical weather prediction and climate models for operational and research purposes. The set-up of the case is based on observations taken during the Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study-1999 (CASES-99), which was held in Kansas, USA in the early autumn with a strong diurnal cycle with no clouds present. The models are forced with a constant geostrophic wind, prescribed surface temperature and large-scale divergence. Results from 30 different model simulations and one large-eddy simulation (LES) are analyzed and compared with observations. Even though the surface temperature is prescribed, the models give variable near-surface air temperatures. This, in turn, gives rise to differences in low-level stability affecting the turbulence and the turbulent heat fluxes. The increase in modelled upward sensible heat flux during the morning transition is typically too weak and the growth of the convective boundary layer before noon is too slow. This is related to weak modelled near-surface winds during the morning hours. The agreement between the models, the LES and observations is the best during the late afternoon. From this intercomparison study, we find that modelling the diurnal cycle is still a big challenge. For the convective part of the diurnal cycle, some of the first-order schemes perform somewhat better while the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) schemes tend to be slightly better during nighttime conditions. Finer vertical resolution tends to improve results to some extent, but is certainly not the solution to all the deficiencies identified.},

  abstract = {Multipole expansion of spatial three-point statistics is introduced as a tool for investigating and displaying configuration dependence. The novel parametrization renders the relation between bi-spectrum and three-point correlation function especially transparent as a set of two-dimensional Hankel transforms. It is expected on theoretical grounds, that three-point statistics can be described accurately with only a few multipoles. In particular, we show that in the weakly non-linear regime, the multipoles of the reduced bispectrum, Ql, are significant only up to quadrupole. Moreover, the non-linear bias in the weakly non-linear regime only affects the monopole order of these statistics. As a consequence, a simple, novel set of estimators can be constructed to constrain galaxy bias. In addition, the quadrupole to dipole ratio is independent of the bias, thus it becomes a novel diagnostic of the underlying theoretical assumptions: weakly non-linear gravity and perturbative local bias. To illustrate the use of our approach, we present predictions based on both power law, and CDM models. We show that the presently favoured SDSS-WMAP concordance model displays strong ``baryon bumps'' in the Ql's. Finally, we sketch out three practical techniques estimate these novel quantities: they amount to new, and for the first time edge corrected, estimators for the bispectrum.},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes ``long term'' simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere--ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of ``near term'' simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These ``decadal predictions'' are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive. For researchers unfamiliar with climate models, the limitations of the models and experiment design are described.},

An initially linear temperature profile is mixed by turbulence near the wall, and a stable thermocline forms above the mixed layer. The thickness of the mixed layer is reduced by the outer layer stratification. Observations from the DNS are used to evaluate the performance of the LES model and to examine the resolution requirements. A resolved LES and a near-wall model LES (NWM--LES) both compare reasonably well with the DNS when the thermal field is treated as a passive scalar. When buoyancy effects are included, the LES mean velocity and temperature profiles also agree well with the DNS. However, the NWM--LES does not sufficiently account for the overturning scales responsible for entrainment at the top of the mixed layer. As a result, the turbulent heat flux and the rate of change of the mixed layer temperature are significantly underestimated in the NWM--LES. In order to accurately simulate the boundary layer growth, the motions responsible for entrainment must either be resolved or more accurately represented in improved subgrid-scale models.},

  abstract = {A stratified bottom Ekman layer over a nonsloping, rough surface is studied using a three-dimensional unsteady large eddy simulation to examine the effects of an outer layer stratification on the boundary layer structure. When the flow field is initialized with a linear temperature profile, a three-layer structure develops with a mixed layer near the wall separated from a uniformly stratified outer layer by a pycnocline. With the free-stream velocity fixed, the wall stress increases slightly with the imposed stratification, but the primary role of stratification is to limit the boundary layer height. Ekman transport is generally confined to the mixed layer, which leads to larger cross-stream velocities and a larger surface veering angle when the flow is stratified. The rate of turning in the mixed layer is nearly independent of stratification, so that when stratification is large and the boundary layer thickness is reduced, the rate of veering in the pycnocline becomes very large. In the pycnocline, the mean shear is larger than observed in an unstratified boundary layer, which is explained using a buoyancy length scale, u*/N(z). This length scale leads to an explicit buoyancy-related modification to the log law for the mean velocity profile. A new method for deducing the wall stress based on observed mean velocity and density profiles is proposed and shows significant improvement compared to the standard profile method. A streamwise jet is observed near the center of the pycnocline, and the shear at the top of the jet leads to local shear instabilities and enhanced mixing in that region, despite the fact that the Richardson number formed using the mean density and shear profiles is larger than unity.},

When the organism is put in a maze, the network changes its shape to connect two exits by the shortest path. This process of path-finding is attributed to an underlying physiological mechanism: a tube thickens as the flux through it increases. The experimental evidence for this is, however, only qualitative. We constructed a mathematical model of the general form of the tube dynamics. Our model contains a key parameter corresponding to the extent of the feedback regulation between the thickness of a tube and the flux through it.

  abstract = {Abstract. The influence of spatial surface temperature changes over the Arctic Ocean on the 2-m air temperature variability is estimated using backward trajectories based on ERA-Interim and the JRA25 wind fields. They are initiated at Alert, Barrow and at the Tara drifting station. Three different methods are used. The first one compares mean ice surface temperatures along the trajectories to the observed 2-m air temperatures at the stations. The second one correlates the observed temperatures to air temperatures obtained using a simple Lagrangian box model which only includes the effect of sensible heat fluxes. For the third method, mean sensible heat fluxes from the model are correlated with the difference of the air temperatures at the model starting point and the observed temperatures at the stations. The calculations are based on MODIS ice surface temperatures and four different sets of ice concentration derived from SSM/I and AMSR-E data. Under nearly cloud free conditions, up to 90\% of the 2-m air temperature variance can be explained for Alert, and 60\% for Barrow using these methods. The differences are attributed to the different ice conditions, which are characterized by high ice concentration around Alert and lower ice concentration near Barrow. These results are robust for the different sets of reanalyses and ice concentration data. Near-surface winds of both reanalyses show a large inconsistency in the Central Arctic, which leads to a large difference in the correlations between modeled and observed 2-m air temperatures at Tara. Explained variances amount to 70\% using JRA and only 45\% using ERA. The results also suggest that near-surface temperatures at a given site are influenced by the variability of surface temperatures in a domain of about 150 to 350 km radius around the site.},

In this study, 1D and 2D scale-selective filters have been implemented using a convolution-based scheme, since a convolution can be readily evaluated in terms of CCAM's native conformal cubic coordinates. The downscaling accuracy of 1D and 2D scale-selective filters is evaluated after downscaling NCEP Global Forecast System analyses for 2006 from 200-km resolution to 60-km resolution over Australia. The 1D scale-selective filter scheme was found to downscale the analyses with similar accuracy to a 2D filter but required significantly fewer computations. The 1D and 2D scale-selective filters were also found to downscale the analyses more accurately than a far-field nudging scheme (i.e., analogous to a boundary-value nudging approach). It is concluded that when the model is required to reproduce the host model behavior above a specified length scale then the use of an appropriately designed 1D scale-selective filter can be a computationally efficient approach to dynamical downscaling for models having a cube-based geometry.},

These simulations are compared with the observations of two cold fronts taken during the Central Australian Fronts Experiment in 1991. The simulations show a number of features that have been suspected, but never confirmed or quantified. (i) Although the wind field in the boundary layer is frontogenetic, daytime turbulent mixing is strongly frontolytic, which accounts for the weakening and deceleration of the fronts during the late morning and afternoon when convective mixing in the boundary layer is most vigorous. (ii) When the mixing subsides in the early evening, the low-level winds increase along with the deformation and convergence, leading to a strengthening and acceleration of the fronts. (iii) Bore-like disturbances are generated during the early hours of the morning as the nocturnal inversion strengthens. These bores propagate ahead of the front, developing a series of large-amplitude waves at their leading edge.},

  abstract = {Abstract Some naturally occurring, continually forced, turbulent, stably stratified, mean shear flows are in a state close to that in which their stability changes, usually from being dynamically unstable to being stable: the time-averaged flows that are observed are in a state of marginal instability. By ``marginal instability'' the authors mean that a small fractional increase in the gradient Richardson number Ri of the mean flow produced by reducing the velocity and, hence, shear is sufficient to stabilize the flow: the increase makes Rimin, the minimum Ri in the flow, equal to Ric, the critical value of this minimum Richardson number. The value of Ric is determined by solving the Taylor--Goldstein equation using the observed buoyancy frequency and the modified velocity. Stability is quantified in terms of a factor, {$\Phi$}, such that multiplying the flow speed by (1 + {$\Phi$}) is just sufficient to stabilize it, or that Ric = Rimin/(1 + {$\Phi$})2. The hypothesis that stably stratified boundary layer flows are in a marginal state with {$\Phi$} {$<$} 0 and with {\textbar}{$\Phi\vert$} small compared to unity is examined. Some dense water cascades are marginally unstable with small and negative {$\Phi$} and with Ric substantially less than {$\frac{1}{4}$}. The mean flow in a mixed layer driven by wind stress on the water surface is, however, found to be relatively unstable, providing a counterexample that refutes the hypothesis. In several naturally occurring flows, the time for exponential growth of disturbances (the inverse of the maximum growth rate) is approximately equal to the average buoyancy period observed in the turbulent region.},

  abstract = {A primary climate change signal in the central Arctic is the melting of sea ice. This is dependent on the interplay between the atmosphere and the sea ice, which is critically dependent on the exchange of momentum, heat and moisture at the surface. In assessing the realism of climate change scenarios it is vital to know the quality by which these exchanges are modelled in climate simulations. Six state-of-the-art regional-climate models are run for one year in the western Arctic, on a common domain that encompasses the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment ice-drift track. Surface variables, surface fluxes and the vertical structure of the lower troposphere are evaluated using data from the SHEBA experiment. All the models are driven by the same lateral boundary conditions, sea-ice fraction and sea and sea-ice surface temperatures. Surface pressure, near-surface air temperature, specific humidity and wind speed agree well with observations, with a falling degree of accuracy in that order. Wind speeds have systematic biases in some models, by as much as a few metres per second. The surface radiation fluxes are also surprisingly accurate, given the complexity of the problem. The turbulent momentum flux is acceptable, on average, in most models, but the turbulent heat fluxes are, however, mostly unreliable. Their correlation with observed fluxes is, in principle, insignificant, and they accumulate over a year to values an order of magnitude larger than observed. Typical instantaneous errors are easily of the same order of magnitude as the observed net atmospheric heat flux. In the light of the sensitivity of the atmosphere--ice interaction to errors in these fluxes, the ice-melt in climate change scenarios must be viewed with considerable caution.},

  abstract = {Observations from the summer Arctic Ocean Experiment 2001 (AOE-2001) are analysed with a focus on the interactions between mesoscale and boundary-layer dynamics. Wavelet analyses of surface-pressure variations show daylong periods with different characteristics, some featuring episodes of pronounced high-frequency surface-pressure variability, here hypothesized to be caused by trapped gravity waves. These episodes are accompanied by enhanced boundary-layer turbulence and an enhanced spectral gap, but with only minor influence on the surface stress. During these episodes, mesoscale phenomena were often encountered and usually identified as front-like features in the boundary layer, with a peak in drizzle followed by changing temperature. These phenomena resemble synoptic fronts, though they are generally shallow, shorter-lasting, have no signs of frontal clouds, and do not imply a change in air mass. Based on this analysis, we hypothesize that the root cause of the episodes with high-frequency surface-pressure variance are shallow, mesoscale fronts moving across the pack ice. They may be formed due to local-to-regional horizontal contrasts, for example, between air with different lifetimes over the Arctic or with perturbations in the cloud field causing differential cooling of the boundary layer. Thermal contrasts sharpen as the air is transported with the mean flow. The propagating mesoscale fronts excite gravity waves, which affect the boundary-layer turbulence and also seem to favour entrainment of free tropospheric air into the boundary layer.},

  abstract = {A generalized Monin--Obukhov similarity hypothesis for the atmospheric surface layer is proposed. It employs the Monin--Obukhov length as a length scale in both the horizontal and vertical directions, in contrast to the original Monin--Obukhov similarity. Therefore, the horizontal turbulence scales, which are contained in multipoint statistics, must be explicitly included. The similarity hypothesis is formulated for the joint probability density function (JPDF) of multipoint velocity and temperature differences and is termed the multipoint Monin--Obukhov similarity (MMO). In MMO, the nondimensional JPDF in the surface layer depends on the separation vectors and the heights from the ground, both nondimensionalized by the Monin--Obukhov length. A key aspect of MMO is that at heights much smaller than the absolute value of the Monin--Obukhov length, both shear and buoyancy can be important. As an application, MMO is used to predict the two-dimensional horizontal turbulence spectra in the convective surface layer. It predicts a two-layer structure with three scaling ranges. Comparisons of the predicted spectra with those obtained using high-resolution large-eddy simulations show general agreement, supporting MMO. Within MMO, full similarity is only achieved for multipoint statistics, while similarity properties (or a lack thereof) for one-point statistics (the original Monin--Obukhov similarity) can be derived from those of multipoint statistics. MMO provides a new framework for analyzing the turbulence statistics and for understanding the dynamics in the atmospheric surface layer.},

  abstract = {In turbulent flow past rigid boundaries, there can be distinguished regions close to the wall in which the local rates of energy production and dissipation are so large that aspects of the turbulent motion concerned with these processes are determined almost solely by the distribution of shear stress within the region and are independent of conditions outside it. These regions are here called equilibrium layers because of the equilibrium existing between local rates of energy production and dissipation. Three kinds of equilibrium layer have been studied experimentally, the constant-stress layer, the transpiration layer and the zero-stress layer, but there are other possible forms. One that is of importance in the theory of self-preserving flow in boundary layers and in diffusers is the `linear-stress' layer in which the stress increases linearly with distance from the wall. The properties of these various equilibrium layers are considered and the distributions of mean velocity are derived from the equation for the turbulent kinetic energy and certain assumptions of flow similarity.             The theory of self-preserving wall flow, usually expressed as a combination of the law of the wall and the defect law, assumes compatibility between the outer flow and the equilibrium layer, and the course of development depends on the kind of equilibrium layer. Earlier work by the author, which assumed the defect law, is only valid if the whole of the equilibrium layer is a constant-stress layer and this is not true in strong adverse pressure gradients. A consistent theory is developed for these flows by assuming a `linear-stress' layer, and the solutions show the relation between flows of finite stress and of zero stress and provide a plausible explanation of the phenomenon of downstream instability observed by Clauser. Self-preserving flow in wedges is treated on similar lines.},

  abstract = {A considerable quantity of observations and measurements exists concerning the phenomenon of intermittency which is connected closely with the entrainment process in free turbulent flows. A number of these are described in the first part of the paper and conclusions are drawn about the shape and motion of the bounding surface that separates turbulent and non-turbulent fluid. The salient features are that indentations of the surface grow and decay cyclically, that each cycle leads to substantial entrainment of ambient fluid into the turbulent region, that the indentations move at a considerable speed relative to the free stream, and that the surface has a comparatively simple form. The growth--decay cycle of the indentations suggests that a critical condition for growth exists, but the pressure field consequent on the convection velocity of the indentations makes for a Helmholtz type of instability that is unlikely to be stabilized by purely viscous behaviour of the turbulent fluid. It is known that the initial response of turbulent fluid to distortion is elastic in character, with incremental Reynolds stress proportional to increment of total strain, and sufficient rigidity could stabilize the bounding surface. A simple flow model--an inviscid stream flowing over an elastic jelly---is examined and the condition for marginal stability is compared with the observed properties of the flow. The model leads to the conclusion that indentations of more than a critical wave-number are stable, and provides reasons for the comparatively simple form of the surface and for the occurrence of indentations in groups of about three. The relative values of entrainment constants in different flows of uniform density do not depend critically on the nature of the entrainment process provided that the main turbulent motion remains geometrically similar, but the correlation between entrainment constant and relative depth of the indentations found by Gartshore (1966) appears as a consequence of the `elastic' control of the growth--decay cycle. Lastly, the properties of the engulfment mechanism are used to show that the entrainment constant for a jet is proportional to the square root of the ratio of ambient density to the average density inside the jet. In contrast, the corresponding result for engulfment controlled by an eddy viscosity is variation as the ratio of the mean of the ambient and inside density to the inside density. Observations of high-speed jets of water in air and air in water give some support to the `elastic' hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Organized structures in turbulent flow fields are a well-known and still fascinating phenomenon. Although these so-called coherent structures are obvious from visual inspection, quantitative assessment is a challenge and many aspects e.g., formation mechanisms and contribution to turbulent fluxes, are discussed controversially. During the ``High Definition Clouds and Precipitation for Advancing Climate Prediction'' Observational Prototype Experiment (HOPE) from April to May 2013, an advanced dual Doppler lidar technique was used to image the horizontal wind field near the surface for approximately 300 h. A visual inspection method, as well as a two-dimensional integral length scale analysis, were performed to characterize the observations qualitatively and quantitatively. During situations with forcing due to shear, the wind fields showed characteristic patterns in the form of clearly bordered, elongated areas of enhanced or reduced wind speed, which can be associated with near-surface streaks. During calm situations with strong buoyancy forcing, open cell patterns in the horizontal divergence field were observed. The measurement technique used enables the calculation of integral length scales of both horizontal wind components in the streamwise and cross-stream directions. The individual length scales varied considerably during the observation period but were on average shorter during situations with z/L {$<$} 0 compared to strongly stable situations. During unstable situations, which were dominated by wind fields with structures, the streamwise length scales increased with increasing wind speed, whereas the cross-stream length scales decreased. Consequently, the anisotropy increased from 1 for calm situations to values of 2--3 for wind speeds of 8--10 m s-1. During neutral to stable situations, the eddies were on average quite isotropic in the horizontal plane.},

  abstract = {We present results of experiments on a turbulent grid flow and a few results on measurements in the outer region of a boundary layer over a smooth plate. The air flow measurements included three velocity components and their nine gradients. This was done by a twelve-wire hot-wire probe (3 arrays {\texttimes} 4 wires), produced for this purpose using specially made equipment (micromanipulators and some other auxiliary special equipment), calibration unit and calibration procedure. The probe had no common prongs and the calibration procedure was based on constructing a calibration function for each combination of three wires in each array (total 12) as a three-dimensional Chebishev polynomial of fourth order. A variety of checks were made in order to estimate the reliability of the results.

An emphasis is put on the necessity to measure invariant quantities, i.e. independent of the choice of the system of reference (e.g.               s                                ij                              s                                ij                              and {$\omega$}                                i                              {$\omega$}                                j                              s                                ij                              ) as the most appropriate to describe physical processes.

Classical and recent turbulence models are reformulated using a unifying notation, making differences in model structure and model parameters more transparent. The essential characteristics of a number of models are compared. It is further demonstrated that the mathematical stability and realisability of the models is crucial for practical applications. The parameter constraints to insure stable computations are discussed. Model performance is evaluated for a number of idealised entrainment scenarios that are typical for shelf seas: entrainment in linearly stratified and twolayer fluids caused by (a) surface wind stress (b) bottom stress due to water motion driven by a barotropic pressure gradient (c) bottom stress due to water motion in a bottom jet. It is shown that the predicted entrainment velocities are in good agreement with available laboratory data, provided the models have been calibrated according to a theoretical constraint. In addition, model behaviour in free convection is re-analysed with the help of recent data from large eddy simulations (LES). It is shown that even the most simple models, which do not solve a differential equation for the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), can approximately reproduce the entrainment depth, however, they fail completely in reproducing the correct budget of the TKE-balance. In contrast, second-order models solving transport equations for the TKE and a length scale determining variable are in reasonable agreement with the TKE-budgets from LES.},

The main focus is on a classical feedback control, which features a simple control architecture and a practical measurement system that are realizable for real-time control of large wind farms. We demonstrate that the wake-induced structural loading of the downstream turbines can be alleviated, while the wind farm power production follows a reference signal. A closed-loop APC is designed first to improve the power-tracking performance against wake-induced power losses of the downwind turbines. Then, the nonunique solution of APC for the wind farm is exploited for aggregated structural load alleviation. The axial induction factors of the individual wind turbines are considered control inputs to limit the power production of the wind farm or to switch to greedy control when the demand exceeds the power available in the wind. Furthermore, the APC solution domain is enlarged by an adjustment of the power set-points according to the locally available power at the waked wind turbines. Therefore, the controllability of the wind turbines is improved for rejecting the intensified load fluctuations inside the wake. A large-eddy simulation model is employed for resolving the turbulent flow, the wake structures, and its interaction with the atmospheric boundary layer. The applicability and key features of the controller are discussed with a wind farm example consisting of 3{\texttimes}4 turbines with different wake interactions for each row. The performance of the proposed APC is evaluated using the accuracy of the wind farm power tracking and the wake-induced damage equivalent fatigue loads of the towers of the individual wind turbines.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Observations of two typical contrasting weakly stable and very stable boundary layers from the winter at Dome C station, Antarctica, are used as a benchmark for two centimetre-scaleresolution large-eddy simulations. By taking the Antarctic winter, the effects of the diurnal cycle are eliminated, enabling the study of the long-lived steady stable boundary layer. With its homogeneous, flat snow surface, and extreme stabilities, the location is a natural laboratory for studies on the long-lived stable boundary layer. The two simulations differ only in the imposed geostrophic wind speed, which is identified as the main deciding factor for the resulting regime. In general, a good correspondence is found between the observed and simulated profiles of mean wind speed and temperature. Discrepancies in the temperature profiles are likely due to the exclusion of radiative transfer in the current simulations. The extreme stabilities result in a considerable contrast between the stable boundary layer at the Dome C site and that found at typical mid-latitudes. The boundary-layer height is found to range from approximately 50 m to just 5 m in the most extreme case. Remarkably, heating of the boundary layer by subsidence may result in thermal equilibrium of the boundary layer in which the associated heating is balanced by the turbulent cooling towards the surface. Using centimetre-scale resolutions, accurate large-eddy simulations of the extreme stabilities encountered in Antarctica appear to be possible. However, future simulations should aim to include radiative transfer and sub-surface heat transport to increase the degree of realism of these types of simulations.},

  abstract = {Geostrophic wind speed data, derived from pressure observations, are used in combination with tower measurements to investigate the nocturnal stable boundary layer at Cabauw, the Netherlands. Since the geostrophic wind speed is not directly influenced by local nocturnal stability, it may be regarded as an external forcing parameter of the nocturnal stable boundary layer. This is in contrast to local parameters such as in situ wind speed, the Monin--Obukhov stability parameter (z/L), or the local Richardson number. To characterize the stable boundary layer, ensemble averages of clear-sky nights with similar geostrophic wind speeds are formed. In this manner, the mean dynamical behavior of near-surface turbulent characteristics and composite profiles of wind and temperature are systematically investigated. The classification is found to result in a gradual ordering of the diagnosed variables in terms of the geostrophic wind speed. In an ensemble sense the transition from the weakly stable to very stable boundary layer is more gradual than expected. Interestingly, for very weak geostrophic winds, turbulent activity is found to be negligibly small while the resulting boundary cooling stays finite. Realistic numerical simulations for those cases should therefore have a comprehensive description of other thermodynamic processes such as soil heat conduction and radiative transfer.},

  abstract = {High-resolution large-eddy simulations of the Antarctic very stable boundary layer reveal a mechanism for systematic and periodic intermittent bursting. A nonbursting state with a boundary layer height of just 3 m is alternated by a bursting state with a height of '5 m. The bursts result from unstable wave growth triggered by a shear-generated Kelvin--Helmholtz instability, as confirmed by linear stability analysis. The shear at the top of the boundary layer is built up by two processes. The upper, quasi-laminar layer accelerates due to the combined effect of the pressure force and rotation by the Coriolis force, while the lower layer decelerates by turbulent friction. During the burst, this shear is eroded and the initial cause of the instability is removed. Subsequently, the interfacial shear builds up again, causing the entire sequence to repeat itself with a time scale of '10 min. Despite the clear intermittent bursting, the overall change of the mean wind profile is remarkably small during the cycle. This enables such a fast erosion and recovery of the shear. This mechanism for cyclic bursting is remarkably similar to the mechanism hypothesized by Businger in 1973, with one key difference. Whereas Businger proposes that the flow acceleration in the upper layer results from downward turbulent transfer of high-momentum flow, the current results indicate no turbulent activity in the upper layer, hence requiring another source of momentum. Finally, it would be interesting to construct a climatology of shear-generated intermittency in relation to large-scale conditions to assess the generality of this Businger mechanism.},

Our new mixing-length concept for turbulent transport in the stable boundary layer follows a rigid-wall analogy, in the sense that we assume that the buoyancy length scale is similar to neutral length scaling. This implies that the buoyancy length scale is: B = {$\kappa$}B zB , with {$\kappa$}B {$\approx$} {$\kappa$}, the von Karman constant. With this concept it is shown that the physical relevance of the local scaling parameter z/ naturally appears, and that the {$\alpha$} coefficient of the log-linear similarity functions {$\varphi$}m,h = 1 + {$\alpha$}z/ is equal to c/{$\kappa$}2, where c is a constant close to unity. The predicted value {$\alpha$} {$\approx$} 1/{$\kappa$}2 = 6.25 lies within the range found in observational studies. Finally, it is shown that the traditionally used inverse linear interpolation between the mixing length in the neutral and buoyancy limits is inconsistent with the classical log-linear stability functions. As an alternative, a log-linear consistent interpolation method is proposed.},

Turbulence is parameterized by first-order closure and the surface heat flux is prescribed, together with the wind speed and temperature at the model top. To study the collapse phenomenon both numerical simulations and linear stability analysis are used. The stability analysis is nonclassical in a sense that the stability of a parameterized set of equations of a turbulent flow is analyzed instead of a particular laminar flow solution. The analytical theory predicts a collapse of turbulence when a certain critical value of the stability parameter {$\delta$}/L (typically O(0.5--1)) is exceeded, with {$\delta$} the depth of the channel and L the Obukhov length. The exact critical value depends on channel roughness to depth ratio z0/{$\delta$}. The analytical predictions are validated by the numerical simulations, and good agreement is found. As such, for the flow configuration considered, the present framework provides both a tool and a physical explanation for the collapse phenomenon.},

It is shown that the nocturnal wind speed profile describes an oscillation around the nocturnal equilibrium wind vector, rather than around the geostrophic wind vector (as in the Blackadar case). By using this perspective, continuous time-dependent wind profiles are predicted. As such, information on both the height and the magnitude of the nocturnal low-level jet is available as a function of time. Preliminary analysis shows that the proposed extension performs well in comparison with observations when a simple Ekman model is used to represent the equilibrium state in combination with a realistic initial velocity profile.},

To this end a cooled, pressure-driven flow is investigated by means of a local similarity model. Simulations reveal a temporary collapse of turbulence whenever the surface heat extraction, expressed in its nondimensional form h/L, exceeds a critical value. As any temporary reduction of turbulent friction is followed by flow acceleration, the long-term state is unconditionally turbulent. In contrast, the temporary cessation of turbulence, which may actually last for several hours in the nocturnal boundary layer, can be understood from the fact that the time scale for boundary layer diffusion is much smaller than the time scale for flow acceleration. This limits the available momentum that can be used for downward heat transport. In case the surface heat extraction exceeds the so-called maximum sustainable heat flux (MSHF), the near-surface inversion rapidly increases. Finally, turbulent activity is largely suppressed by the intense density stratification that supports the emergence of a different, calmer boundary layer regime.},

  abstract = {The collapse of turbulence in the nocturnal boundary layer is studied by means of a simple bulk model that describes the basic physical interactions in the surface energy balance. It is shown that for a given mechanical forcing, the amount of turbulent heat that can be transported downward is limited to a certain maximum. In the case of weak winds and clear skies, this maximum can be significantly smaller than the net radiative loss minus soil heat transport. In the case when the surface has low heat capacity, this imbalance generates rapid surface cooling that further suppresses the turbulent heat transport, so that eventually turbulence largely ceases (positive feedback mechanism). The model predicts the minimum wind speed for sustainable turbulence for the so-called crossing level. At this level, some decameters above the surface, the wind is relatively stationary compared to lower and higher levels. The critical speed is predicted in the range of about 5--7 m s21, depending on radiative forcing and surface properties, and is in agreement with observations at Cabauw. The critical value appears not very sensitive to model details or to the exact values of the input parameters. Finally, results are interpreted in terms of external forcings, such as geostrophic wind. As it is generally larger than the speed at crossing height, a 5 m s21 geostrophic wind may be considered as the typical limit below which sustainable, continuous turbulence under clear-sky conditions is unlikely to exist. Below this threshold emergence of the very stable nocturnal boundary layer is anticipated.},

  abstract = {This paper describes MicroHH 1.0, a new and open-source (www.microhh.org) computational fluid dynamics code for the simulation of turbulent flows in the atmosphere. It is primarily made for direct numerical simulation but also supports large-eddy simulation (LES). The paper covers the description of the governing equations, their numerical implementation, and the parameterizations included in the code. Furthermore, the paper presents the validation of the dynamical core in the form of convergence and conservation tests, and comparison of simulations of channel flows and slope flows against well-established test cases. The full numerical model, including the associated parameterizations for LES, has been tested for a set of cases under stable and unstable conditions, under the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations, and with dry and moist convection under stationary and time-varying boundary conditions. The paper presents performance tests showing good scaling from 256 to 32 768 processes. The graphical processing unit (GPU)enabled version of the code can reach a speedup of more than an order of magnitude for simulations that fit in the memory of a single GPU.},

  abstract = {A method to analyze the daily cycle of evapotranspiration over land is presented. It quantifies the influence of external forcings, such as radiation and advection, and of internal feedbacks induced by boundary layer, surface layer, and land surface processes on evapotranspiration. It consists of a budget equation for evapotranspiration that is derived by combining a time derivative of the Penman--Monteith equation with a mixed-layer model for the convective boundary layer. Measurements and model results for days at two contrasting locations are analyzed using the method: midlatitudes (Cabauw, Netherlands) and semiarid (Niamey, Niger). The analysis shows that the time evolution of evapotranspiration is a complex interplay of forcings and feedbacks. Although evapotranspiration is initiated by radiation, it is significantly regulated by the atmospheric boundary layer and the land surface throughout the day. In both cases boundary layer feedbacks enhance the evapotranspiration up to 20 W m22 h21. However, in the case of Niamey this is offset by the land surface feedbacks since the soil drying reaches 230 W m22 h21. Remarkably, surface layer feedbacks are of negligible importance in a fully coupled system. Analysis of the boundary layer feedbacks hints at the existence of two regimes in this feedback depending on atmospheric temperature, with a gradual transition region in between the two. In the low-temperature regime specific humidity variations induced by evapotranspiration and dry-air entrainment have a strong impact on the evapotranspiration. In the high-temperature regime the impact of humidity variations is less pronounced and the effects of boundary layer feedbacks are mostly determined by temperature variations.},

  abstract = {We present a conceptual model for the diurnal cycle of the dry atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). It may serve as a framework for future numerical studies on the transitional dynamics that characterize the ABL over land. The conceptual model enables us to define expressions for relevant physical scales as a function of the most prominent forcing parameters and the low degree of complexity facilitates a dimensionless description. This is useful to help generalize boundary layer dynamics that occur on a diurnal time scale. Further, the model's application for numerical studies is illustrated herein with two examples: a single-column-model study that assesses the effect of wind forcing on the main characteristics of the diurnal cycle, and a large-eddy-simulation study on the daily evolution of turbulence under weak-wind-forcing conditions. The results from these studies sketch the general evolution of the present set of diurnal-cycle systems in more detail. We discuss how the setups are able to reproduce well-known dynamical features of the ABL and also highlight limitations, where the simple conceptual system is unable to describe realistic ABL behavior. We conclude that the present conceptual model has an interesting balance between model-system complexity and physical realism, such that it is useful for future idealized studies on the diurnal cycle of the ABL.},

  abstract = {Field observations and theoretical analysis are used to investigate the appearance of different nocturnal boundary layer regimes. Recent theoretical findings predict the appearance of two different regimes: the continuously turbulent (weakly stable) boundary layer and the relatively ``quiet'' (very stable) boundary layer. A large number of nights (approximately 4500 in total) are analyzed using an ensemble averaging technique. The observations support the existence of these two fundamentally different regimes: weakly stable (turbulent) nights rapidly reach a steady state (within 2--3 h). In contrast, very stable nights reach a steady state much later after a transition period (2--6 h). During this period turbulence is weak and nonstationary. To characterize the regime, a new parameter is introduced: the shear capacity. This parameter compares the actual shear after sunset with the minimum shear needed to sustain continuous turbulence. In turn, the minimum shear is dictated by the heat flux demand at the surface (net radiative cooling), so that the shear capacity combines flow information with knowledge of the boundary condition. It is shown that the shear capacity enables prediction of the flow regimes. The prognostic strength of this nondimensional parameter appears to outperform the traditional ones like the similarity parameter z/L and the gradient Richardson number Ri as a regime indicator.},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;We perform direct numerical simulation of the Couette flow as a model for the stable boundary layer. The flow evolution is investigated for combinations of the (bulk) Reynolds number and the imposed surface buoyancy flux. First, we establish what the similarities and differences are between applying a fixed buoyancy difference (Dirichlet) and a fixed buoyancy flux (Neumann) as boundary conditions. Moreover, two distinct parameters were recently proposed for the turbulent-to-laminar transition: the Reynolds number based on the Obukhov length and the \&quot;shear capacity,\&quot; a velocity-scale ratio based on the buoyancy flux maximum. We study how these parameters relate to each other and to the atmospheric boundary layer. The results show that in a weakly stratified equilibrium state, the flow statistics are virtually the same between the different types of boundary conditions. However, at stronger stratification and, more generally, in nonequilibrium conditions, the flow statistics do depend on the type of boundary condition imposed. In the case of Neumann boundary conditions, a clear sensitivity to the initial stratification strength is observed because of the existence of multiple equilibriums, while for Dirichlet boundary conditions, only one statistically steady turbulent equilibrium exists for a particular set of boundary conditions. As in previous studies, we find that when the imposed surface flux is larger than the maximum buoyancy flux, no turbulent steady state occurs. Analytical investigation and simulation data indicate that this maximum buoyancy flux converges for increasing Reynolds numbers, which suggests a possible extrapolation to the atmospheric case.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Using the UCLA-LES code with a traditional Smagorinsky-Lilly subgrid model and a simplified land-surface scheme, a sensitivity study to grid spacing is performed. At horizontal grid spacings ranging from 3.125 m in which we are capable of resolving most turbulence in the cases of interest to grid a spacing of 100 m which is clearly insufficient to resolve the NBL, the ability of LES to represent the NBL and the influence of NBL biases on the subsequent daytime development of the convective boundary layer are examined. Although the low-resolution experiments produce substantial biases in the NBL, the influence on daytime convection is shown to be small, with biases in the afternoon boundary layer depth and temperature of approximately 100 m and 0.5 K, which partially cancel each other in terms of the mixed-layer top relative humidity.},

The authors apply a statistical clustering methodology based on a bounded variation, finite-element method (FEM-BV) to characterize the interaction between small-scale nonturbulent motions and turbulence. The clustering methodology achieves a multiscale representation of nonstationary turbulence data by approximating them through an optimal sequence of locally stationary multivariate autoregressive factor model (VARX) processes and some slow hidden process switching between them. The clustering method is used to separate periods with different influence of the nonturbulent motions on the vertical velocity fluctuations.

In those periods, the presence of a negative peak in the cospectra followed by a decrease of the flux magnitude and levelling off of the heat flux is clearly apparent and associated with turbulent transport. The turbulent scales inferred from the cospectra appear to be smaller than approximately 200 s for the example in cluster 1 and smaller than approximately 400 s for the example in cluster 3, both time-scales corresponding to the levelling off of the MRD cospectra in Figure 3. Note that this result implies that the choice of 1 min averaging windows used in the clustering procedure discards some of the turbulent contributions to the vertical velocity fluctuations in clusters 1 and 3. The time-scale 1/NBV associated with the Brunt--Va{\textasciidieresis}isa{\textasciidieresis}la{\textasciidieresis} frequency NBV = \{(g/T)(dT/dz)\}1/2 is 11 s in the example of cluster 1 and 61 s in the example of cluster 3. The distribution of the total flux is very different in the periods extracted from clusters 2 and 4. One can still see a slight negative peak followed by a decrease of the flux magnitude and levelling off probably due to turbulent transport in those periods, but it is associated with smaller scales (generally faster than 20 s for both examples) and the magnitude of the corresponding flux is very small. Larger scales of motions (slower than 20 s in these examples) have stronger contributions to the total flux. In these two examples, the time-scale 1/NBV is approximately 3.7 s (cluster 2) and 3.8 s (cluster 4).},

  abstract = {An intentional yaw misalignment of wind turbines is currently discussed as one possibility to increase the overall energy yield of wind farms. The idea behind this control is to decrease wake losses of downstream turbines by altering the wake trajectory of the controlled upwind turbines. For an application of such an operational control, precise knowledge about the inflow wind conditions, the magnitude of wake deflection by a yawed turbine and the propagation of the wake is crucial. The dependency of the wake deflection on the ambient wind conditions as well as the uncertainty of its trajectory are not sufficiently covered in current wind farm control models. In this study we analyze multiple sources that contribute to the uncertainty of the estimation of the wake deflection downstream of yawed wind turbines in different ambient wind conditions. We find that the wake shapes and the magnitude of deflection differ in the three evaluated atmospheric boundary layers of neutral, stable and unstable thermal stability. Uncertainty in the wake deflection estimation increases for smaller temporal averaging intervals. We also consider the choice of the method to define the wake center as a source of uncertainty as it modifies the result. The variance of the wake deflection estimation increases with decreasing atmospheric stability. Control of the wake position in a highly convective environment is therefore not recommended.},

  abstract = {In the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting Model (ARW), versions 3.0 and earlier, advection of scalars was performed using the Runge--Kutta time-integration scheme with an option of using a positive-definite (PD) flux limiter. Large-eddy simulations of aerosol--cloud interactions using the ARW model are performed to evaluate the advection schemes. The basic Runge--Kutta scheme alone produces spurious oscillations and negative values in scalar mixing ratios because of numerical dispersion errors. The PD flux limiter assures positive definiteness but retains the oscillations with an amplification of local maxima by up to 20\% in the tests. These numerical dispersion errors contaminate active scalars directly through the advection process and indirectly through physical and dynamical feedbacks, leading to a misrepresentation of cloud physical and dynamical processes. A monotonic flux limiter is introduced to correct the generally accurate but dispersive solutions given by high-order Runge--Kutta scheme. The monotonic limiter effectively minimizes the dispersion errors with little significant enhancement of numerical diffusion errors. The improvement in scalar advection using the monotonic limiter is discussed in the context of how the different advection schemes impact the quantification of aerosol--cloud interactions. The PD limiter results in 20\% (10\%) fewer cloud droplets and 22\% (5\%) smaller cloud albedo than the monotonic limiter under clean (polluted) conditions. Underprediction of cloud droplet number concentration by the PD limiter tends to trigger the early formation of precipitation in the clean case, leading to a potentially large impact on cloud albedo change.},

The flux-variance relation for temperature and humidity was investigated over prairie and desert-shrub plant communities. Fluxes were measured by one-dimensional eddy correlation, humidity by fast-response wet-bulb psychrometers and Krypton open-path hygrometers, temperature by fine-wire thermocouples, and mean windspeed by a cup anemometer. The quality of the flux-variance relation proved to be good enough for application to flux measurement. Regressions of flux estimated by the variance technique versus measured flux usually had rZ values greater than 0.97 for sensible heat flux and greater than 0.88 for water vapor flux. More uniform surfaces tended to yield the same flux-variance relations except when fluxes were small. This exception supported the hypothesis that sparse sources of flux may increase variance downwind. Nonuniform surfaces yielded flux-variance relations that were less predictable, although reasonably accurate once determined. The flux-variance relation for humidity was quite variable over dry surfaces with senescent vegetation.},

A promising approach is the LES WALE model, which can be used without wall functions or global damping functions. The model produces an efficient and fast scheme due to its algebraic character. Additionally, its prediction of the transition from laminar to turbulent regimes has shown promising results. In this work, the LES WALE model is investigated within the lattice Boltzmann framework. For validation purposes, various test cases are presented. First, a channel flow at a Reynolds number of 6876 is investigated. Secondly, the flow around a wall-mounted cube at various Reynolds numbers is determined. The flow regime varies from laminar, to transitional, to fully turbulent conditions at a Reynolds number of 40,000 with respect to the cube height.},

The jet carries a fluorescent dye measured with planar               laser-induced fluorescence               (LIF), and the surface discontinuity in the scalar concentration is identified as the fluctuating turbulent jet interface. Thence the mean outward `boundary entrainment' velocity is derived and shown to be a constant fraction (about 0.07) of the the mean jet velocity on the centreline. Profiles of the conditional mean velocity, mean scalar and momentum flux show that at the interface there are clear discontinuities in the mean axial velocity and mean scalar and a tendency towards a singularity in mean vorticity. These actual or asymptotic discontinuities are consistent with the conditional mean momentum and scalar transport equations integrated across the interface. Measurements of the fluxes of turbulent kinetic energy and enstrophy are consistent with computations by Mathew \& Basu (               Phys. Fluids               , vol. 14, 2002, pp. 2065--2072) in showing that for a jet flow (without forcing) the entrainment process is dominated by small-scale eddying at the highly sheared interface (`nibbling'), with large-scale engulfing making a small (less than 10\%) contribution consistent with concentration measurements showing that the interior of the jet is well mixed. (Turbulent jets differ greatly from the free shear layer in this respect.) To explain the difference between velocity and scalar profiles, their conditional mean gradients are defined in terms of a local eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity and the momentum and scalar fluxes inside the interface. Since the eddy diffusivity is larger than the eddy viscosity, the scalar profile is flatter inside the interface so that the scalar discontinuity is relatively greater than the mean velocity discontinuity. Theoretical arguments, following Hunt, Eames \& Westerweel (in               Proc. of the IUTAM Symp. on Computational Physics and New Perspectives in Turbulence               , ed. Y. Kaneda, vol. 4, 2008, pp. 331--338, Springer), are proposed for how the vortex sheet develops, how the internal structure of the interface layer relates to the inhomogeneous rotational and irrotational motions on each side and why the dominant entrainment process of jets and wakes differs from that of free shear layers.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of sonic anemometer-derived stress estimates to the tilt of the anemometer is investigated. The largest stress errors are shown to occur for unstable stratification (z/L{$<$}0) and deep convective boundary layers. Three methods for determining the tilt angles relative to a mean streamline coordinate system and for computing the tilt-corrected stresses are then compared. The most commonly used method, involving a double rotation of the anemometers' axes, is shown to result in significant run-to-run stress errors due to the sampling uncertainty of the mean vertical velocity. An alternative method, requiring a triple rotation of the anemometer axes, is shown to result in even greater run-to-run stress errors due to the combined sampling errors of the mean vertical velocity and the cross-wind stress. For measurements over the sea where the cross-stream stress is important, the double rotation method is shown to overestimate the surface stress, due to the uncorrected lateral tilt component. A third method, using a planar fit technique, isshown to reduce the run-to-run stress errors due to sampling effects, and provides an unbiased estimate of the lateral stress.},

An experiment in the shear layer of a circular jet has shown that the usual definitions, based on peaks of the space-time correlations of the fluctuations, yield convection velocities whose magnitudes depend on the value of space or time separation chosen. An alternative approach shows that, by considering the turbulent field as a superposition of harmonic travelling waves, a wave-number/velocity spectrum can be defined that lends itself to the definition of a wave-number-dependent convection velocity and an overall convection velocity, both of which have real physical significance. An experimental technique is described for obtaining the spectrum, and results are presented for one position in the shear layer of the jet.},

  abstract = {In this study, shear-based parameterizations of turbulent mixing in the stable atmospheric boundary layer (SABL) are proposed. A relevant length-scale estimate for the mixing length LM of the turbulent momentum field is constructed from the turbulent kinetic energy Ek and the mean shear rate S as LEkS [ Ek1/2/S. Using observational data from two field campaigns---the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment and the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere--Surface Exchange Study (CASES-99)---LEkS is shown to have a strong correlation with LM. The relationship between LM and LEkS corresponds to the ratio of the magnitude of the tangential components of the turbulent momentum flux tensor t to Ek, known as stress intensity ratio, c2 5 t/Ek. The field data clearly show that c2 is linked to stability. The stress intensity ratio also depends on the flow energetics that can be assessed using a shear-production Reynolds number, ReSP 5 P/(nS2), where P is shear production of turbulent kinetic energy and n is the kinematic viscosity. This analysis shows that high mixing rates can indeed persist at strong stability. On this basis, shear-based parameterizations are proposed for the eddy diffusivity for momentum, KM, and eddy diffusivity for heat, KH, showing remarkable agreement with the exact quantities. Furthermore, a broader assessment of the proposed parameterizations is given through an a priori evaluation of large-eddy simulation (LES) data from the first GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS). The shear-based parameterizations outperform many existing models in predicting turbulent mixing in the SABL. The results of this study provide a framework for improved representation of the SABL in operational models.},

  abstract = {In mesoscale modeling the scale l of the energy- and flux-containing turbulence is much smaller than the scale ⌬ of the spatial filter used on the equations of motion, and in large-eddy simulation (LES) it is much larger. Since their models of the subfilter-scale (SFS) turbulence were not designed to be used when l and ⌬ are of the same order, this numerical region can be called the ``terra incognita.'' The most common SFS model, a scalar eddy diffusivity acting on the filtered fields, emerges from the conservation equations for SFS fluxes when several terms, including all but one of the production terms, are neglected. Analysis of data from the recent Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (HATS) shows that the neglected production terms can be significant. Including them in the modeled SFS flux equations yields a more general SFS model, one with a tensor rather than a scalar eddy diffusivity. This more general SFS model is probably not necessary in fine-resolution LES or in coarse-resolution mesoscale modeling, but it could improve model performance in the terra incognita.},

In this study, we reproduce and analyze this sensitivity issue using two stratocumulus cases, one marine and one continental. Results show that (1) the sensitivity is associated with spurious motions near the moisture jump between the boundary layer and the free atmosphere, and (2) these spurious motions appear to arise from neglecting small variations in water vapor mixing ratio (qv) in the pressure gradient calculation in the acoustic substepping portion of the integration procedure. We show that this issue is remedied in the WRF dynamical core by replacing the prognostic equation for the potential temperature h with one for the moist potential temperature hm5h(1 1 1.61qv), which allows consistent treatment of moisture in the calculation of pressure during the acoustic substeps. With this modification, the spurious motions and the sensitivity to the time stepping settings (i.e., the dynamic time step length and number of acoustic sub-steps) are eliminated in both of the example stratocumulus cases. This modification improves the applicability of WRF for LES applications, and possibly other models using similar dynamical core formulations, and also permits the use of longer time steps than in the original code.},

Three stability conditions are considered: stable, neutral, and unstable, with the same geostrophic wind speed aloft and the same Coriolis frequency. Both a single 5MW turbine and a wind farm of five turbines are studied. The single-turbine wake is strongly correlated with stability, in terms of velocity deficit, turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and temperature distribution. Because of the Coriolis effect, the wake shape deviates from a Gaussian distribution. For the wind-farm simulations, the separation of the core region and outer region is clear for the stable and neutral cases, but less distinct for the unstable case. The unstable case exhibits strong horizontal variations in wind speed. Local accelerations such as related to aisle jets are also observed, whose features depend on stability. The added TKE in the wind farm increases with stability. The highest power extraction and lowest power deficit are observed for the unstable case.},

A sufficiently strong positive feedback is hypothesized to lead to the destruction of the cloud. Numerous studies have investigated the possible role of CTEI in cloud breakup, with ambiguous results.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}In this study, CTEI has been extensively investigated using many large-eddy simulations.

When CTEI takes place in the numerical experiments, entrainment develops spontaneously through buoyancy reversal and, as a result, leads to cloud dissipation. Cloud dissipation within several hours is simulated in the cases with strong instability. A hypothesized dependence of the strength of the evaporatively driven turbulence on the cloud-top liquid water mixing ratio is confirmed. As expected, with a typical stratocumulus liquid water mixing ratio, the evaporatively driven turbulence is weak.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Additional simulations with longwave radiation, surface latent heat flux, or both suggest that sufficiently strong radiative cooling can prevent cloud destruction by CTEI. For this reason, CTEI usually does not result in cloud dissipation in realistic cases.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The MCAR, however, imposes complex covariance structures that are difficult to interpret and estimate. This article develops a much simpler alternative approach building upon the techniques of smoothed ANOVA (SANOVA). Instead of simply shrinking effects without any structure, here we use SANOVA to smooth spatial random effects by taking advantage of the spatial structure. We extend SANOVA to cases in which one factor is a spatial lattice, which is smoothed using a CAR model, and a second factor is, for example, type of cancer. Datasets routinely lack enough information to identify the additional structure of MCAR. SANOVA offers a simpler and more intelligible structure than the MCAR while performing as well. We demonstrate our approach with simulation studies designed to compare SANOVA with different design matrices versus MCAR with different priors. Subsequently a cancer-surveillance dataset, describing incidence of 3-cancers in Minnesota's 87 counties, is analyzed using both approaches, showing the competitiveness of the SANOVA approach.},

The tangent linear and adjoint codes of the WRF model (WRFPLUS) now have the following improvements: A complete check interface ensures that developers write accurate tangent linear and adjoint codes with ease and efficiency. A new technique based on the nature of duality that existed among message passing interface communication routines was adopted to parallelize the WRFPLUS model. The registry in the WRF model was extended to automatically generate the tangent linear and adjoint codes of the required communication operations. This approach dramatically speeds up the software development cycle of the parallel tangent linear and adjoint codes and leads to improved parallel efficiency. Module interfaces were constructed for coupling tangent linear and adjoint codes of the WRF model with applications such as four-dimensional variational data assimilation, forecast sensitivity to observation, and others.},

  abstract = {Summertime observations for 11 yr from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility Southern Great Plains (SGP) site are used to investigate mechanisms controlling the transition from shallow to deep convection over land. It is found that a more humid environment immediately above the boundary layer is present before the start of late afternoon heavy precipitation events. The higher moisture content is brought by wind from the south. Greater boundary layer inhomogeneity in moist static energy, temperature, moisture, and horizontal wind before precipitation begins is correlated to larger rain rates at the initial stage of precipitation. In an examination of afternoon rain statistics, higher relative humidity above the boundary layer is correlated to an earlier onset and longer duration of afternoon precipitation events, whereas greater boundary layer inhomogeneity and atmospheric instability in the 2--4-km layer above the surface are positively correlated to the total rain amount and the maximum rain rate. Although other interpretations may be possible, these observations are consistent with theories for the transition from shallow to deep convection that emphasize the role of a moist lower free troposphere and boundary layer inhomogeneity.},

This method preserves the extended stability property of the RKC method for solving ODEs, and it requires only one projection per step. An additional projection on the time derivative of the velocity is performed whenever a second-order approximation for the pressure is desired. We demonstrate both by numerical experiments and by order analysis that the method is second order accurate in time for both the velocity and the pressure. Being explicit, the RKC projection method is easy to implement and to parallelize. Hence it is an attractive candidate for the solution of large-scale, moderately stiff, diffusion-like problems.},

These results are also discussed and rationalized with respect to other parameterizations in the literature. This paper demonstrates the role of M--O similarity in setting the mixing efficiency of equilibrated constant-flux layers, and the effects of Prandtl number on mixing in wall-bounded stratified turbulent flows.},

Three time series models (a simple model, advanced model, and full model) are used for estimating surface reflectance for each pixel, and the selection of a time series model is dependent on the number of clear observations available: the more clear observations, the more complex the model will be that is used. For each time series model there are three components (seasonality, trend, and breaks), that are used for modeling intra-annual and inter-annual differences and abrupt surface change. Abrupt surface changes are detected by differencing predicted and observed Landsat observations, and if the difference is larger than twice the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for six consecutive observations, it will be detected as a ``break'' in the time series model. The RMSE values are temporally adjusted to provide better threshold range. For each ``synthetic'' image, a Quality Assessment (QA) Band is provided that contains information on how the time series model was estimated and used for generating the synthetic data. We have applied this approach to six Landsat scenes within the United States. We visually compared the synthetic images with real Landsat images for different kinds of environments and they are similar for all image pairs. We also quantitatively assessed the accuracy of the synthetic data by calculating the RMSE value for all clear Landsat observations. The RMSE values for the three visible bands are the lowest (approximately 0.01), and the Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) bands are slightly higher in magnitude (between 0.01 and 0.02). The Near Infrared (NIR) band has the highest RMSE values (between 0.02 and 0.03). The goal of this paper is to provide Landsat images that are free of cloud, cloud shadow, snow, and Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off gaps that can be used to derive land cover and bio-physical products.},

  abstract = {Currently no expression for the equilibrium depth ofthe turbulent stably-stratified boundary layer is available that accounts for the combined effects of rotation, surface buoyancy flux and static stability in the free flow. Various expressions proposed to date are reviewed in the light of what is meant by the stable boundary layer. Two major definitions are thoroughly discussed. The first emphasises turbulence and specifies the boundary layer as a continuously and vigorously turbulent layer adjacent to the surface. The second specifies the boundary layer in terms of the mean velocity profile, e.g. by the proximity of the actual velocity to the geostrophic velocity. It is shown that the expressions based on the second definition are relevant to the Ekman layer and portray the depth of the turbulence in the intermediate regimes, when the effects of static stability and rotation essentially interfere. Limiting asymptotic regimes dominated by either stratification or rotation are examined using the energy considerations. As aresult, a simple equation for the depth of the equilibrium stable boundary layer is developed. It is valid throughout the range of stability conditions and remains in force in the limits of a perfectly neutral layer subjected to rotation and a rotation-free boundary layer dominated by surface buoyancy flux or stable density stratification at its outer edge. Dimensionless coefficients are estimated using data from observations and large-eddy simulations. Well-known and widely used formulae proposed earlier by Zilitinkevich and by Pollard, Rhines and Thompson are shown to be characteristic of the above interference regimes, when the effects of rotation and static stability (due to either surface buoyancy flux, or stratification at the outer edge of the boundary layer) are roughly equally important.},

  abstract = {The planetary boundary layer (PBL), which directly interacts with the underlying surface, differs significantly in its nature from the low turbulent stably stratified free atmosphere. Fluctuations of the Earth's surface heat balance immediately affect the PBL and assimilate there owing to the effective mechanism of turbulent heat transfer. In this case the upper boundary of the PBL plays the role of a cover, preventing the direct penetration of thermal effects and contaminants into an overlying atmospheric layer. In view of this, air pollution is especially dangerous when associated with shallow PBL. In addition, local peculiarities of climate change are mainly determined by the PBL height due to the high sensitivity of thin stably stratified PBLs to the thermal effects. Deep convective PBLs are not very sensitive to weak thermal effects, but they significantly affect the formation of convective cloudiness and the climate system as a whole by means of the turbulent entrainment of the thermal energy, humidity, aerosols, and other admixtures through the upper boundary. The PBL height and turbulent entrainment must be calculated when simulating and forecasting air pollution, abnormal frosts and heat, and other hazardous phenomena. In this paper we discuss the state of the art knowledge in the area of PBL height simulation and suggest a new model of turbulent entrainment for con vective PBLs.},

  abstract = {Turbulence is ever produced in the low-viscosity/large-scale fluid flows by velocity shears and, in unstable stratification, by buoyancy forces. It is commonly believed that both mechanisms produce the same type of chaotic motions, namely, the eddies breaking down into smaller ones and producing direct cascade of turbulent kinetic energy and other properties from large to small scales toward viscous dissipation. The conventional theory based on this vision yields a plausible picture of vertical mixing and has remained in use since the middle of the twentieth century in spite of increasing evidence of the fallacy of almost all other predictions. This paper reveals that in fact buoyancy produces chaotic vertical plumes, merging into larger ones and producing an inverse cascade toward their conversion into the self-organized regular motions. Herein, the velocity shears produce usual eddies spreading in all directions and making the direct cascade. This new paradigm is demonstrated and proved empirically; so, the paper launches a comprehensive revision of the theory of unstably stratified turbulence and its numerous geophysical or astrophysical applications.},

Although a vast proportion of the parameter range of wall-bounded stably stratified turbulence is still unexplored (in particular when stratification is strong), numerical simulations and experiments have recently developed a fairly robust picture of the flow structure, also providing essential ground for addressing more complex problems of paramount technological, environmental and geophysical importance.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Precipitation and surface temperature are two of the most important variables that describe our weather and climate. Several previous studies investigated aspects of their relationship, for instance the climatological dependence of daily precipitation on daily mean temperature, \emph{P}(\emph{T}). However, the role of specific weather systems in shaping this relationship has not been analysed yet. This study therefore identifies the weather systems (WSs) that are associated with intense precipitation days as a function of \emph{T}, focusing on the question of how this relationship, symbolically expressed as \emph{P}(\emph{T}, WS), varies regionally across the Northern Hemisphere and between seasons. To this end, we first quantify if intense precipitation occurs on climatologically warmer or on colder days. In winter, over most continental and ocean regions, intense precipitation falls on warmer days apart from the Mediterranean area and regions in the lee of the Rocky Mountains, where intense precipitation is favoured on colder days. In summer, only at high latitudes is intense precipitation favoured on warmer days, whereas continental areas experience intense precipitation on colder days. For selected regions in Europe and North America, we then identify the weather systems that occur preferentially on days with intense precipitation (referred to as wet days). In winter, cyclones are slightly dominant on colder wet days, whereas warm conveyor belts and atmospheric rivers occur preferentially on warmer wet days. In summer, the overall influence of atmospheric rivers increases, and the occurrence of weather systems depends less on wet day temperature. Wet days in the lee of the Rocky Mountains are influenced by most likely convective systems in anticyclones. Finally, we investigate \emph{P}(\emph{T}, WS) during the wettest and driest season in central Europe and the central United States (US). In qualitative agreement with the results from the first part of this study, the wettest winter is warmer than normal in central Europe but colder in the central US, and the wettest summer is colder in both regions. The opposite holds for the driest winter and summer, respectively. During these anomalous seasons, both the frequency and the precipitation efficiency of weather systems change in central Europe, while the wettest and driest seasons in central US mainly arise from a modified precipitation efficiency. Our results show that the precipitation--temperature--weather system relationship strongly depends on the region and that (extreme) seasonal precipitation is influenced by the frequency and precipitation efficiency of the different weather systems. This regional variability is reflected in the relative importance of weather system frequency and efficiency anomalies for the formation of anomalously wet and dry seasons. Interestingly, in some regions and seasons, the precipitation efficiency of weather systems is increased during anomalously cold seasons.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
