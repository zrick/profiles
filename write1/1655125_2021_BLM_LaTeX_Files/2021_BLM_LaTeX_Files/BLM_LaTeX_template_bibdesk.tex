\begin{abstract}Limit the Abstract to 250 words. The Abstract should not be overly descriptive, should focus on main results and conclusions, and should not contain any undefined abbreviations. Acronyms, if needed, must be defined at first use. Avoid citing literature, but if absolutely necessary, the reference should be given as, e.g., ``based on Gheynani and Taylor (Boundary-Layer Meteorology, 2010, Vol. 137, 223--236)''. The use of mathematical symbols in the Abstract should be avoided.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Start writing the Introduction here. Carry on to the next page, ensuring that author information remains at the bottom of the first page. Lines and pages should be numbered. The font used should be clearly legible, and symbols in the font (including subscripts and superscripts) should be checked for legibility.

\section{Section Title}
\label{sec:1}
The remaining body of the text should be placed here, divided appropriately into sections. Individual words in all section, subsection, and secondary subsection titles should start with upper case letters. Avoid hanging titles by keeping the title and section text together on the same page. Do not use acronyms in section titles. Sections should be referred to in the text as Sect. 1, unless starting a new sentence, in which case Section 1 should be used. Multiple sections should be referred as Sects. 1 and 2, or Sects. 3â€“5.

\section{Next Section Title}
Text can be further divided into subsections as demonstrated below.

\subsection{Acronyms}
All acronyms should be defined at first use, both within the Abstract and in the main text. If an acronym is defined in the Abstract, it should be defined again at first use in the main body of text. Acronyms should not be used in manuscript titles, and excessive usage of acronyms should be avoided, particularly of those which are not commonly employed in meteorological literature. Two-letter acronyms should be used in exceptional cases and only for well-established word combinations. When making acronyms plural, make sure to use an ``s" (e.g., the term ``low-level jets" becomes ``LLJs"). Acronyms that are used as variables should be written in Italic (e.g., $TKE$, $LAI$), however, one-letter notation for variables, such as $e$ for turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), is preferable.

\subsection{Spelling and Grammar}
Generally, British (UK) spelling should be used. Spelling examples for frequently used terms include: airflow, anticyclonic, autocorrelation, behaviour, centre, colour, cospectrum, covariance, cross-section, cross-spectrum, dataset, daytime, freestream, grey, lidar, metre, nonlinear, night-time, point-of-view, set-up, subgrid, subrange, time scale, timestep, turbulence intensity, turbulence kinetic energy.

It should be noted that though British spelling is generally used, when it comes to words ending in yse/yze and ise/ize, the American z-form is used, such as in analyze, characterize, idealize, normalize, and parametrize.

Personal names should be spelled and formatted correctly, in particular: Boussinesq, Kolmogorov, Obukhov, Prandtl, V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a}, and von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n.

Above ground level, above sea level, left-hand side, random mean square, and right-hand side are abbreviated, respectively, as a.g.l., a.s.l., l.h.s., r.m.s., and r.h.s.

Geographical directions should be written as south, north-west, south-east, north-north-west, etc. A clause involving two words should be hyphenated (-) when used as an adjective, but not when otherwise used (e.g., boundary layer, boundary-layer depth, wind tunnel, wind-tunnel observations, turbulence of small scale, small-scale turbulence, 10-m wind speed). The en dash (--) should be used in Monin--Obukhov theory, Brunt--V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency, London--Paris railway, linear--log plot, atmosphere--ocean interaction, north--south, in the period 1970--2000, and in other cases when it could be replaced with the words ``and", ``to", ``through", etc. Use of the Oxford comma is required.

\subsection{Units}
The International System of Units (SI) and derived SI units should be used (e.g., m, km, s). The units should be typed in Roman font, not in Italic. Units requiring an exponent should be typed with a space between the portions of the unit, and using superscripts for the power, e.g., m~s$^{-1}$, kg~m$^{-3}$, J~kg$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$ (do not write these as m/s, kg/m$^3$, J/kg/K).

\subsection{Variables and Symbols}
All variables should be typed in an appropriate font (see Sect. 3.1), and written consistently throughout the main text, the figure captions, figure axis legends, and in tables. Generally, variables should be written in Italic (e.g., $p$, $T$, $\rho$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\theta$, $e$, $LAI$), except for Greek capital letters, which should not be italicized and vectors, which are Bold (e.g., \textbf{v}, \textbf{F}). Mathematical signs used in the text should have a space on either side of the sign (e.g., write $x$ = 0.1 m, $\beta$ $<$ 3, $z/L$ $\geq$ 5, etc.). Functions (e.g., log, ln, exp, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan, min, max, etc.), e (base of natural logarithm), i (imaginary unit), and $\pi$ (the number Pi) should be in Roman font. Dimensionless parameters/numbers, like Reynolds number ($Re$), Richardson number ($Ri$), Rossby number ($Ro$), etc., should be written in Italic.

When writing numbers in scientific notation, use the multiplication symbol rather than the letter x (e.g., write 4 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ rather than 4 x 10$^{-3}$). To indicate approximate equality, use the symbol $\approx$ rather than the symbol $\sim$, which should be used to indicate ``on the order of". The symbol $\propto$ is reserved to indicate proportionality. Avoid beginning sentences with mathematical symbols or expressions. 

In \textit{Boundary-Layer Meteorology}, ``Obukhov length'' is used rather than ``Monin--Obukhov length''. The surface-layer and boundary-layer `star' variables (scales) should be written in the format $T_*$, $u_*$, $q_*$, and $w_*$, i.e., with a subscript asterisk.

\subsection{Equations}
Line equations should be centred in the line. Equations to which reference is made elsewhere in the text must be numbered sequentially, starting with (1), and equations that are not referenced in the text need not be numbered. The numbering should continue through the text and into the appendices, if present. Symbols used in the equations should appear in the same format as in the text. Where an equation (e.g., number 10) has several parts, these parts should be indicated as (10a), (10b), (10c), etc., with each part on a separate line. Equations should be included within sentence structures, if possible, with surrounding punctuation used as appropriate. All variables that appear in the equations for the first time should be explained.

A numbered line equation example:
\begin{equation}
\overline{(\delta{T})^2}(\textbf{r},t)=\overline{[T(\textbf{x},t)-T(\textbf{x}+\textbf{r},t)]^2},
\end{equation}
where $T$ is temperature, $\overline{(\delta{T})^2}$ is the temperature structure function, \textbf{x} is a position vector, \textbf{r} is a separation vector, the overbar denotes spatial averaging, and $t$ is time. A non-numbered equation example:
\begin{equation*}
\overline{(\delta{T})^2}(\textbf{r},t)=\overline{[T(\textbf{x},t)-T(\textbf{x}+\textbf{r},t)]^2}.
\end{equation*}
The paragraph following a line equation should not be indented. Equations should be referred to in the text as Eq. 1, unless starting a new sentence, in which case Equation 1 should be used. Referring to equations by their number, e.g., ``as indicated by (1)", or ``the right-hand side of (25)" is also acceptable.

Equations presented in the appendices should continue the sequential numbering from the main text, i.e., if the last equation in the main text is (20), then the first equation in the appendices should be (21). If multiple appendices with equations are included then the sequential numbering continues throughout the appendices in the order the equations are presented.

\subsection{Times and Dates}
Times should be written in the format 0000 UTC, 1523 UTC, etc., using the 24-hour clock and no colons. If times correspond to local time, then at first introduction LT should be defined and the difference from UTC should be stated, e.g., ``at 1945 LT (local time = UTC $-$ 6 h)". The acronym UTC does not need to be defined.

Dates in the main text of a manuscript should be written in a date-month-year format, e.g., 23 April 2011, 7 January 2016. Dates that are being included in a table or figure can be shortened to the format 23/04/2011, 07/01/2016, with day before month.

\subsection{Instruments}
The make and model of instruments used in experimental campaigns reported in the manuscript should be listed. For example, ``An eddy-covariance gas analyzer (LI-7500DS, LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) was used to measure the water vapour density" or ``wind profiles were recorded using a PCS.2000 Doppler sodar (Metek, Elmshorn, Germany)".

\subsection{Citations}
Citations should be presented in an appropriate format, for example: ``as found by \cite{Mason+1987}'', ``\cite{Garratt1994} demonstrated that...'', ``as found in previous studies \citep{Mason+1987,Garratt1994,Wyngaard2004,Marusic++2011}", and should be given in order of year. Note that commas are not used to separate author name and citation year. This is accomplished by adding \verb\setcitestyle{aysep={}}\ after \verb\usepackage{natbib}\ at the beginning of the document.

If two papers within a group of citations are from the same authors, these should be listed together and ordered by the oldest cited article, for example, ``\citep{Mason+1987,Beljaars+1990,Beljaars+1991,Garratt1994}". Please note that articles currently in preparation or in review should not be cited, but those available via early online release may be cited using the DOI.

\subsubsection{Further Subsections}
If secondary subsections are required, the headings should be italicized.

\section{Figures}

Figures should be included as demonstrated by Fig. \ref{fig1} and numbered sequentially, starting at number 1. Figures with multiple panels should have panels labelled as a, b, c, etc. When referring to a figure in the text, use ``Fig." unless starting a new sentence, when ``Figure" is appropriate. For example, ``... as illustrated by the blue dashed line in Fig. \ref{fig1}." or ``Figure \ref{fig1} shows that ...". Multiple-panel figures can be referred to using, for example, ``... as illustrated by the blue dashed line in Fig. 2b, d." or ``Figure 2c shows that ...".

All figures should include a caption. The figures should be placed within the appropriate section in the main text. The number of figures should not exceed 15. All figures should be checked for legibility and consistency of the figure contents, axes labels, and any legends. It is preferable to use mathematical notation for variables in the labels rather than their names. Variables should be defined not in the figure legend but in the text describing the figure in the paper or in the caption. 

Units and variables used within figures should be in the same format and font as in the main text, i.e., variables should be written in Italic font and units in Roman font. Figures included in any appendices should continue the sequential numbering from the main text, e.g., if there are 11 figures in the main text then the first figure in the first appendix should be labelled as Fig. 12 and not Fig. A1. File types that can be used are: .pdf, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .eps, .epsf, .epsi, .pgf, .tikz, .ps.

\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics{Fig1.png}
\caption{Write an appropriate figure caption here. Discussions of the implications of the results shown in the figure should be left for the main text. Captions do not end with periods}
\label{fig1}     
\end{figure}


\section{Tables}
Tables should be clearly presented, easy to read, and should be numbered sequentially. Variables presented in the tables should be formatted in the same manner as in the text (e.g., Italic variables and Bold vectors). Each table should include a preceding caption. Tables should be cited as ``Table 1", e.g., ``Table 1 shows ..." or ``the sensible heat flux values are presented in Table 1". If tables are included in the appendices, then these tables should be numbered sequentially continuing from the last table in the main text. Limit the number of tables to five.

\begin{table}
\caption{Write an appropriate caption for the table here. Captions do not end with periods}
\label{tab:1}       
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
Variable & Number & Date  \\
\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textit{x} & 1 & 15/05/2019 \\
\textit{y} & 2 & 16/05/2019 \\
\textit{z} & 3 & 17/05/2019 \\
\noalign{\smallskip}\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Reference Formatting}
References should be presented in alphabetical order (not in the order of their appearance in the text). They should not be numbered. The total number of pages is not required for book references. List all authors (editors) of referred publications. References can be entered manually using the bibitem structure, or through BibTex (recommended). BibTex users should use the spbasic bibliography style and the natbib package. Sample references of several types are shown below: a journal article \citep{Mason+1987}, a book \citep{Garratt1994}, a book chapter \citep{Wyngaard2004}, a dissertation \citep{Fedorovich1986,Salesky2014}, a technical report \citep{Newsom++2015}, and a paper in conference proceedings \citep{Kaimal1979,Batchvarova+2003, Marusic++2011}.


\begin{acknowledgements}
These should follow the concluding section of the paper and precede the References and any appendices, if they are present. The acknowledgements section does not require a section number. 
\end{acknowledgements} 

\section*{Appendix 1: Title of Appendix}
\{Appendices are optional, as are appendix titles\}\\
Appendices should precede the references and should be numbered (if there is more than one appendix). Equations, tables, and figures contained within the appendices should be numbered sequentially following those in the main text.
